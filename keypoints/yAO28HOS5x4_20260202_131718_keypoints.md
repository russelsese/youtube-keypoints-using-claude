## Chapter 1: Introduction - Why Tools Matter in the AI Era
**Timestamp:** 00:00 - 00:35

- With AI writing code, the choice of tools has become more critical than ever
- The video covers a complete tech stack for shipping applications with AI
- Topics include frameworks, styling, payments, authentication, AI tools, deployment, and development workflows
- The presentation will be comprehensive and detailed ("in the weeds")

**Lessons**
- Tool selection matters more when AI is generating code, as some tools work better with AI than others
- A complete tech stack should cover all aspects from frontend to deployment
- Understanding your entire toolchain helps you ship faster with AI assistance

**Stories**
- The speaker emphasizes this is their actual production stack, not theoretical recommendations

**Examples**
- Mentions specific topics: web/mobile frameworks, styling, payments, authentication, AI tools, deployment platforms, AI models

## Chapter 2: Web and Mobile Frameworks
**Timestamp:** 00:35 - 09:23

- Next.js is the primary frontend framework despite alternatives like Tanstack Start
- ElysiaJS serves as the backend framework, superior to Hono and comparable to Express for Node
- Convex is the main backend platform, providing database, real-time capabilities, webhooks, cron jobs, and more
- Turbo Repo handles monorepo management for projects with both web and mobile apps
- Expo is used for cross-platform mobile development

**Lessons**
- AI models haven't been trained on newer frameworks, leading to hallucinations
- Release candidate software is risky for production deployments
- Infrastructure-as-code approaches (like Convex) enable AI to build complex features
- Type safety and end-to-end integration (like Eden with ElysiaJS) improve both developer and AI experience

**Stories**
- The speaker reached out to Convex for a job because they loved the product so much, not the other way around
- Built a personal finance dashboard using Trading View alerts, Convex webhooks, and real-time updates across Next.js and Expo

**Examples**
- Setting up ElysiaJS with Next.js: creating app/api/[...slugs]/route.ts as a catch-all route
- Eden provides TRPC-like end-to-end type safety with ElysiaJS
- Personal finance app: Trading View alerts → Convex webhook → real-time updates to Next.js and Expo apps
- Convex features: database, webhooks, cron jobs, scheduled functions, background jobs, queues

- Starting with pre-configured setups accelerates project initialization

**Lessons**
- Pre-configured styling systems save time at project start
- Visual customization tools make it easy to establish design consistency
- Component libraries should integrate seamlessly with your CSS framework

**Stories**
- The speaker typically starts projects by using Shadcn's project generator with custom configurations

**Examples**

## Chapter 5: Authentication Solutions
**Timestamp:** 12:34 - 13:14

- Three main options: Clerk, WorkOS, and Better Auth
- Clerk is the easiest to set up
- Better Auth has growing integrations and a Convex component
- WorkOS is the choice for enterprise applications
- All three solutions are viable with different use cases

**Lessons**
- Choose authentication based on your specific needs: ease (Clerk), enterprise features (WorkOS), or growing ecosystem (Better Auth)
- You can't go wrong with any of the three options
- Enterprise requirements should drive you toward WorkOS

**Stories**
- The speaker has used all three solutions in different projects

**Examples**
- Clerk for quick setup
- Better Auth with improving Convex component
- WorkOS for enterprise applications

## Chapter 6: AI Development Tools
**Timestamp:** 13:14 - 16:52

- Daytona provides sandbox environments for AI coding agents
- AI SDK (by Vercel) is the primary TypeScript framework for building agents
- Claude's Agent SDK is "the most slept on" tool for building Claude Code instances
- Composio handles tool integration layer for connecting AI to external services

**Lessons**
- Sandbox environments are essential for AI agents that need file system access
- Well-documented SDKs with extensive tutorials reduce friction
- Tool integration layers prevent building repetitive connections to external services
- Combining Agent SDKs with sandboxes unlocks powerful applications

**Stories**
- Building Sandstorm app (successor to Ralphie) using Daytona sandboxes to let users build applications with cloud code agents
- Ralphie project has reached 1.6k stars on GitHub

**Examples**
- Daytona for spinning up cloud code agents in isolated sandboxes
- AI SDK features: well-supported, well-documented, extensive tutorials
- Claude Agent SDK for spinning up Claude Code instances with various capabilities
- Composio integrations: Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, GitHub, Google Sheets, Shopify, Google Drive
- Composio setup: initialize, create entity with user ID, configure tools, pass to AI SDK

## Chapter 7: Deployment Platforms
**Timestamp:** 16:52 - 18:08
