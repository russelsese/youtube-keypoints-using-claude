[00:00] Hey there. In this video, I want to talk
[00:01] to you about Bento. It's the email
[00:02] marketing platform that I've been using
[00:03] for the last couple years, and I just
[00:04] used it to launch my new course. You can
[00:06] check that out below. There's a link in
[00:07] the description. But I do want to talk
[00:09] to you about it today because I came to
[00:11] the realization that I have probably
[00:13] been lacking pretty heavily on my email
[00:16] marketing game. And if you are as well,
[00:18] I think the things in Bento and the AI
[00:21] implementations and things that they
[00:22] have in there that are actually useful
[00:24] might get you to be a little bit more
[00:26] excited about what I previously thought
[00:28] was kind of like an old and not very
[00:31] important thing to care about in, you
[00:33] know, email marketing. But it actually
[00:35] is the thing that really seemingly gets
[00:37] people to actually purchase your stuff.
[00:39] If you're out there on YouTube or
[00:40] wherever and you're kind of like doing
[00:41] the distribution paths and you are
[00:44] trying to get your stuff out there,
[00:45] email marketing, building that email
[00:47] list, it's kind of important. Let's dive
[00:48] into it. I'll show you around. Okay, so
[00:50] here we are. I'll leave a link in the
[00:51] description for you to go check out
[00:53] Bento. You can get a free 30-day
[00:54] unlimited trial. Would definitely take
[00:56] advantage of that. It's a pretty sick
[00:57] platform, like I said. But Bento is the
[01:00] AI email marketing and CRM company.
[01:02] That's a pretty good H1, if I do say so
[01:04] myself. um really cool things like this
[01:06] website has actually changed a lot since
[01:08] I looked at it. I have some other
[01:09] content about Bento that I'll link up
[01:11] below as well if you want to check it
[01:12] out from a couple years ago. But again,
[01:14] the the platform, the UI and everything
[01:16] has just the team has just changed so
[01:18] much in such a short amount of time that
[01:20] you know you're going to get more value
[01:22] out of this one than you would the other
[01:23] ones. But I think it's still good to see
[01:25] kind of where they came from. They're
[01:26] always doing like really cool stuff. And
[01:27] again, the AI pieces of it are not just
[01:30] fluff here. They're actually useful when
[01:32] you're building flows and everything.
[01:33] and we'll get into it. Um, but yeah,
[01:35] this is just kind of the main website
[01:36] here. If we hop into the back end, you
[01:38] can kind of see just a little bit of the
[01:39] stats here. I'm going to jump back and
[01:41] forth between my Seamansky Media, like
[01:44] my main uh account, and then also my
[01:47] just like a test site account that I set
[01:49] up here. I do want to call out a couple
[01:51] quick little things here. We're not
[01:52] going to go over every single one of
[01:53] these cuz some of these things haven't
[01:54] changed from before, but I do want to
[01:55] highlight the ones that helped me the
[01:57] most in my most recent uh product
[01:59] launch. Uh up here you can see that you
[02:01] actually have multiple accounts like all
[02:03] under one different thing. I have
[02:05] multiple different user accounts that I
[02:07] can log in and be admins for. But um
[02:09] their pricing structure is really cool.
[02:10] It's just kind of like one price for
[02:12] like all your users and then you can
[02:14] have multiple different basically again
[02:15] I would call these like websites. Um so
[02:18] Seamansky Media is my content business
[02:19] my media stuff. Motive 11 is my agency.
[02:22] So those are different just to
[02:23] understand those are different databases
[02:25] like they have different there's a
[02:26] different list of people for motive 11.
[02:28] There's a different list of people for
[02:30] semantic media. You don't have to do it
[02:31] like this if you don't want to, but it's
[02:32] really cool that you can kind of have
[02:33] everything separated there, but at the
[02:35] same time, everything is also accessible
[02:38] from one or separate users depending on
[02:41] how you want it. Um, yeah, you're just
[02:43] going to have to play around with that,
[02:44] see what you like uh during your free
[02:45] trial and everything. But yeah, this is
[02:46] Seamansky Media. Like I said, there's
[02:48] some basic stats here. Just some things
[02:49] that we got going on. Um, if we head
[02:51] down into people, you can see a bunch of
[02:53] different stuff. I'll obscure the, you
[02:55] know, email addresses and all that, but
[02:56] you can see kind of on the right side,
[02:57] you can see if they're subscribed at a
[02:59] glance, events, uh, that have taken
[03:01] place, the statuses of what, you know,
[03:03] like any sort of tagging and everything
[03:05] like that. Um, if they've paid you any
[03:07] money, like you can see cuz, um, there's
[03:09] a bunch of different things that have
[03:11] happened here. And depending on your
[03:12] situation, I want to tell you kind of
[03:14] like I think the best way to do this is
[03:15] tell you the high level so you can
[03:17] understand what's possible. But I also
[03:19] don't want to like I can give you my
[03:22] exact situation, but yours probably
[03:23] isn't the same. The real quick uh
[03:25] synopsis of my situation was that I was
[03:27] using a WordPress website specifically
[03:29] with Shart, but you could use Woo
[03:30] Commerce, you could use Shopify, you use
[03:32] a ton of different platforms and you can
[03:34] integrate the two, Bento and your
[03:36] e-commerce platform. And then most of
[03:38] the time it basically automatically when
[03:40] a charge goes through and the person
[03:42] gets added to your email list and
[03:43] everything, it just knows that there's
[03:45] an event and they paid you $49 or
[03:47] whatever the case is. And then you it's
[03:49] a really nice way to know in your email
[03:51] marketing platform the LTV of any
[03:54] particular email address or you know
[03:56] customer in that case. Right now right
[03:57] off the bat here I want to illustrate to
[03:58] you just like a little bit of AI in the
[04:01] sense of quality of life when you're
[04:02] dealing with your email list. Like,
[04:04] let's be honest here. Nobody really
[04:05] wants to spend a lot of time in their
[04:07] email marketing tool. They don't want to
[04:08] be messing around and playing around
[04:10] with different things that they don't
[04:11] have to. So, let me just show you a
[04:12] couple different things. If you head
[04:13] over to segments here, you can kind of
[04:14] see some of the segments that I have.
[04:16] You can see the number of people that
[04:17] are in them. Uh the number of subs
[04:19] versus just the number of users, right?
[04:21] That type of thing. If we come back to
[04:23] people, we could see that if you come
[04:25] into search, right? Like you have your
[04:27] big list. This is like your full list of
[04:29] people. It's, you know, pageionated, so
[04:30] it's not like everyone at the same time,
[04:32] but like you could very easily just with
[04:34] plain text up here. It says, "Type who
[04:36] you want to find in your own words."
[04:38] Now, I could type, okay, but I'm going
[04:39] to give you another little gold nugget
[04:41] here. And I'll have a link in the
[04:42] description to this. It's called Whisper
[04:44] Flow. Okay? I am affiliated with them,
[04:46] but I literally use it every day,
[04:49] multiple hours per day because I don't
[04:50] want to type anymore because I could
[04:52] just speak faster and just do, you know,
[04:53] whatever I want. So, I'm going to hold
[04:55] down two buttons on my keyboard. You're
[04:56] going to see a little see a little thing
[04:57] pop up and you'll see the uh the text
[04:59] generate. Find me builders that have
[05:02] purchased
[05:04] the WP AI course. And notice I didn't
[05:07] even say that exactly how it says in the
[05:11] tags, right? Like you can see some of
[05:12] the tags down here. It just
[05:14] automatically knows and brings in from
[05:16] that. I mean that's like kind of like an
[05:17] obuscated use of AI, right? It's just
[05:20] like in the back end and you're just
[05:21] searching and it's it's creating that.
[05:23] But the thing is like you know in a lot
[05:25] of cases you probably have to search
[05:27] that and then add these these rules like
[05:29] on your own. It's just a pretty cool
[05:30] thing where you're able to do that just
[05:32] with your voice even or just typing. But
[05:34] the point of that in under 5 seconds I
[05:36] was able to say that and then it was
[05:38] able to find those users and then I was
[05:40] and then I'd be able to search users and
[05:41] now I'll see all of those people down
[05:43] here and I could do whatever I needed to
[05:45] do with them. So that's pretty cool.
[05:46] That's our first use of AI. Again, I
[05:47] don't want to go through everything but
[05:48] I do just want to kind of give you a
[05:49] little bit of lay before you get that
[05:51] free trial. So, we have tags here. And
[05:53] again, you can kind of change these out
[05:54] however you want. The one thing I will
[05:56] say is that Bento takes a different
[05:58] approach to this. They don't really have
[06:00] like true like tags and lists. Like you
[06:02] can see lists down here, but that's like
[06:04] a different use case. It's mostly tags.
[06:06] Like it's that's the basis of
[06:08] everything. It plays in really well with
[06:10] like the events that come again from
[06:12] your website or anything like that. Like
[06:14] if we head down to events for instance,
[06:16] we can see like all the different views
[06:17] and things that people have actually
[06:19] like this is literally tracking the uh
[06:22] the data that is coming through my
[06:23] website. You put a little script on
[06:24] there. Uh you link it up and then you
[06:26] know it's it's beautiful because now you
[06:27] have more data in your actual email
[06:29] marketing platform, not just in Google
[06:32] Analytics or Plausible or wherever. So
[06:34] uh again just more data. That's
[06:35] definitely uh fantastic. And then over
[06:37] here we have fields where these are
[06:39] custom fields that you can kind of
[06:41] configure potentially you know obviously
[06:42] a first name last name etc. But you know
[06:44] maybe you want to have phone in there
[06:46] maybe uh maybe you want to have like
[06:48] where they bought their you know their
[06:49] product from the page that they had it
[06:51] so you know uh attached literally to
[06:53] their actual profile you know just more
[06:56] data depending on what you're trying to
[06:58] do. Also want to call out a little bit
[06:59] of a UI Easter egg if you will is
[07:01] there's things like this where it's like
[07:02] used in and it says likely used in
[07:04] flows. Now we didn't get to flows yet.
[07:06] That's kind of like the whole point of
[07:07] like the biggest part of the AI piece of
[07:09] this. But if you click on that, then
[07:11] it's going to take you over to where
[07:13] your flows are. Now, I have double
[07:15] opt-in. I have some stuff for the agency
[07:17] and the agency course. And then I have
[07:18] like another older double opt-in
[07:20] feature. And we'll play around with some
[07:21] of these types of things. But the point
[07:22] is that we were on fields and it was
[07:25] like, okay, well, you don't want to like
[07:27] you want to make sure that you don't
[07:28] delete data in general, but you also
[07:30] don't want to make sure that you aren't
[07:32] deleting things that are used in a flow.
[07:34] And again, a flow is like an automation
[07:36] for your marketing, right? Somebody's,
[07:38] you know, subscribing and you're making
[07:39] sure that they are getting, you know,
[07:41] again, double opted and are confirmed.
[07:43] Uh, you know, somebody is subscribing to
[07:45] or purchasing something from you. You're
[07:47] sending them some welcome emails. You
[07:49] know, I mean, you could have a ton of
[07:50] them depending on how big your your
[07:51] apparatus is for your service or your
[07:53] product. But again, if we go back to the
[07:55] fields, it's just one of those things.
[07:56] It's like, oh, that's kind of really
[07:58] interesting that, you know, everything
[07:59] feels a little bit more cohesive when
[08:01] you have small little UI things like
[08:03] that. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and
[08:04] switch into the test site here for this
[08:06] next little bit. And depending on where
[08:08] you're at in your email marketing
[08:09] journey, the thing that you might know
[08:10] the most about is just like a simple
[08:13] broadcast or like an eblast depending on
[08:15] what you thinking about when you, you
[08:16] know, whatever your verbiage is there.
[08:17] So, if you come down to emails, you can
[08:19] see how to start a broadcast. There's
[08:20] sequences, there's all these other
[08:22] things, but let's just talk about real
[08:23] quick what is the actual sending of a
[08:26] simple broadcast like in Bento. So,
[08:28] we're creating new broadcast here and we
[08:29] can obviously start with AI. There's a
[08:31] couple different ways that you can build
[08:32] emails, too. I will say uh I I think
[08:35] most of like the general email lists
[08:37] that I'm subscribed to nowadays are just
[08:40] almost formatted as like plain text
[08:42] maybe like an image or two. If you
[08:45] subscribe to a lot of like I don't know
[08:47] like legacy stores like big box stores
[08:49] and stuff you're probably going to get
[08:50] more of like the drag and drop style
[08:53] where there's like it almost looks like
[08:54] a website in an email rather than just
[08:57] like plain text. You're going to have to
[08:58] decide. I was that guy before the drag
[09:00] and drop and now I'm more of just the
[09:02] text editor. But uh you're going to have
[09:03] to decide which one you want. But
[09:05] regardless, I mean, you know, we could
[09:06] start with AI and kind of get some
[09:08] thoughts. And then there's AI modes in
[09:09] both. I'll kind of show you. Now, if you
[09:10] were actually going to do this right now
[09:12] and start with AI, I would recommend
[09:13] that you give it a better prompt than
[09:15] I'm about to give it, but uh you know,
[09:17] generally a lot more detail kind of the
[09:19] better if you want to get a better
[09:20] output. But uh for the time being, I'm
[09:22] just going to say, "Hey there. I want to
[09:25] announce to all my subscribers that I
[09:27] have a course called AI powered
[09:28] WordPress agency. Uh the price is $199.
[09:32] They can get lifetime access today.
[09:36] So just something like that and click
[09:37] generate. Now I think by default it's
[09:39] going to go to the uh just the text
[09:42] editor that we were talking about there
[09:43] first, but there's the other option
[09:44] where you could also go to the um
[09:47] there's AI mode in the other one. I'll
[09:49] show you that in a second. This takes a
[09:51] little bit, maybe like 10, 15 seconds or
[09:53] whatever, but then it blops it right in
[09:54] there. Look at that. That's beautiful.
[09:55] Now, as always, I feel like I have to
[09:57] say this. Please, for the love of God,
[09:58] do not just use this, okay? I would give
[10:00] it better context in the prompt. And
[10:02] then I would also obviously edit it. But
[10:04] the fact that it's all integrated in
[10:05] there and it took 15 seconds, pretty
[10:07] cool. If you're not impressed yet
[10:08] because that's just text, hang on to
[10:10] your hats. We're going to get to the
[10:11] flows in a second. But to close the loop
[10:13] on the text editor here and how you can
[10:14] edit with it, obviously there's a bunch
[10:16] of different things here. It's like your
[10:17] standard email marketing platform for
[10:18] formatting and everything. But on the
[10:20] right hand sidebar, as you can see now
[10:21] that I moved my face, is that you can
[10:23] conversate back and forth with the AI
[10:25] chat just like you would in most other
[10:28] like LLM style chat bots. And it even
[10:30] gives you some little things down here
[10:31] at the bottom to say like make it
[10:32] shorter, add urgency, deadline. I like
[10:34] that. Let's just throw that in there.
[10:35] See what it does. Again, very vague
[10:37] prompt. Would not recommend.
[10:41] So there we go. A little bit more
[10:42] inspiration, some edits that it made for
[10:43] us that we can go ahead and continue to
[10:45] tweak on our own. I'm going to go back
[10:46] out and click add a new broadcast. Now,
[10:49] we're going to try the drag and drop
[10:51] mode. So, as you can see, if you're
[10:52] familiar with like Constant Contact or
[10:54] Mailchimp, this is like much more of I
[10:56] feel like what you would be accustomed
[10:57] to. And if you're more comfortable here,
[10:59] then, you know, do your thing. But, we
[11:00] have an AI mode. Right away, I'm seeing
[11:02] an absolutely diabolical prompt down
[11:04] here that it's asking me to potentially
[11:05] do. So, I'm going to click make more
[11:07] modern. See what that does. I actually
[11:08] really appreciate that it didn't just do
[11:10] anything and it did ask me what I meant
[11:12] because you know that's uh definitely
[11:14] how you should respond as an LLM and not
[11:16] just do some random And I feel
[11:17] like if you are somebody that wants to
[11:19] actually leverage AI inside of tools
[11:21] like not just for text but for you know
[11:23] doing your own work right I think this
[11:25] is something that you want so you can
[11:26] have more of a conversation with it back
[11:28] and forth and kind of dial in what you
[11:30] want before it actually makes the
[11:31] changes. So, I'm just going to say,
[11:33] yeah, go ahead with the second option
[11:36] and then um change the color to
[11:40] um more of like a black and electric
[11:44] blue like you said.
[11:48] All right. So, kind of cool. It did some
[11:50] stuff. Again, at the end of the day,
[11:52] this is basically just code. So, if you
[11:54] just like looked at the code, you can
[11:55] kind of like deal with whatever you
[11:57] wanted. I gave it some other prompts
[11:59] just again kind of like our example of
[12:01] like you know me launching the course
[12:02] and it did a decent job again with very
[12:05] very limited information. Uh again if
[12:07] you're trying to do something like this
[12:09] I would highly recommend that you
[12:10] actually give it enough context but the
[12:11] point is that it can do some pretty
[12:13] interesting things that at least is
[12:15] going to get you more of the way there
[12:17] than you would. And I think that in a
[12:19] lot of cases that is a huge win. Now all
[12:21] that's pretty important obviously in an
[12:22] email marketing platform but uh it's
[12:25] pretty basic. So I want to show you
[12:26] something else. Just a couple more
[12:27] things here real quick. So, this one is
[12:29] chat. Now, chat is literally like a chat
[12:31] widget that you can put on your website.
[12:33] I don't have, you know, the time in this
[12:35] video to show you the entire thing, but
[12:37] I will give you kind of a overview on it
[12:39] and show you how the AI kind of works
[12:40] because you can have an AI agent
[12:42] directly in the chat for you all within
[12:44] your email marketing platform. You don't
[12:45] need to go somewhere else to to do this.
[12:47] So, again, we have our test site set up
[12:49] here. Uh we have different inboxes. You
[12:51] can add more. You could do like, you
[12:52] know, even like other email, SMS, and
[12:54] all this other stuff. Let's just keep
[12:56] this simple, okay? Just for this basic
[12:57] overview here, though. Let's go up here
[12:59] and let's say conversations. And we can
[13:01] see that there's already one set up. I
[13:02] went ahead and I set it up. All it is is
[13:04] like a little script that you paste onto
[13:05] your website. You can do wherever uh you
[13:07] know, whatever. I just did it in like a
[13:09] quick little WordPress situation here.
[13:11] But this is just a template just to kind
[13:12] of give you something to look at. I'll
[13:13] move my face over here. And then we have
[13:16] a little thing here down at the bottom,
[13:17] right? It's the same thing you would
[13:18] expect, right? It's a little chatbot
[13:20] down here. And then you can just say
[13:21] different things to it. So you could say
[13:23] like, "Hey, how are you? Can you tell me
[13:25] about, you know, what's going on today?
[13:27] Now, again, there's not really I I did
[13:29] skip a step here. Obviously, I'll show
[13:30] you how to do this, but like it's not
[13:32] fully interacted and like there's no
[13:35] knowledge base attached to this yet. So,
[13:36] I have no idea what this is going to
[13:37] give me. The whole point of it is though
[13:39] that you have now an AI agent that is on
[13:41] your website, right? So, it's here to
[13:43] help to related to test site. If you
[13:45] need any questions, just let me know,
[13:47] etc., etc. But again, this is built with
[13:49] AI, okay? This is all like internal
[13:50] though. I didn't have to hook anything
[13:52] up. I didn't have to like go get API
[13:53] keys or anything like that. If you want
[13:54] a simple out of the box solution and
[13:56] you're already using Bento for your
[13:57] email marketing platform, uh you know,
[13:59] check it out while you're on your trial.
[14:00] So, let me flip back here. Let me move
[14:02] my face back. And uh let me just kind of
[14:04] show you just real quickly some of these
[14:05] things. So, like right here is where you
[14:07] would go for the autonomous agents. So,
[14:08] you can set up your agent. All I did was
[14:10] create an agent. I'll just create
[14:11] another one here real quick. Some of
[14:12] this stuff is already default. You can
[14:14] name it whatever you want. Give it a
[14:15] description, avatar. Uh you can go in
[14:17] here and you tell it what inboxes you
[14:19] want to set it up for. So, in our case,
[14:21] it was just we just have the one, but
[14:22] you could do for multiple different
[14:23] ones. I'll click this and then I'll come
[14:25] through here to personality. There's a
[14:28] lot of different things. And this is
[14:28] kind of again like you're kind of tuning
[14:30] your own AI a little bit with this. And
[14:33] then you're also able to you're not a
[14:36] not not only you're able to tune it like
[14:38] the actual AI part, but again, when we
[14:40] talk about like the memories and the and
[14:42] the the actual information, obviously,
[14:44] it needs some of that. You don't want it
[14:46] to just be like a rogue AI that people
[14:48] are talking to. in in practice, this
[14:50] would be about your website, right? And
[14:52] you would be able to um you know, it'd
[14:54] be able to give knowledge based on the
[14:56] information that you have about your
[14:57] business. Uh but yeah, so you can kind
[14:59] of change a bunch of different uh things
[15:01] about these. And then it can even
[15:02] escalate, you know, too as well. Like if
[15:04] you know, like like you always probably
[15:06] do on your apps when you're dealing with
[15:08] chat, you're like, "Hey, just get me to
[15:10] a human like if it can't fix it." The
[15:12] idea is that this is kind of a first
[15:13] line of defense, right? So if we come
[15:15] over to memories, you can add your first
[15:16] memory. You can do page, sitemap, RSS
[15:18] feed. Uh, that's actually pretty cool. I
[15:20] haven't actually tried this yet, so, you
[15:22] know, let me know down in the comments
[15:23] if you want to see more about this or if
[15:25] you play around with it and have any
[15:26] thoughts, but there's a bunch of
[15:27] different ways to add that. I did see
[15:29] one other thing here. Not sure if it's
[15:31] going to pop back up, but I saw
[15:33] something uh about Docsbot. I think
[15:35] there's like integrations. So, there's
[15:37] like web hooks and then like different
[15:39] little like applications and stuff that
[15:40] you could connect to these uh obviously
[15:42] automation rules and such. But um you
[15:45] know it's the problem here is it's
[15:47] really going to depend on your use case,
[15:48] right? So uh depending on what you need
[15:50] it for as far as your knowledge base,
[15:52] you can probably make that happen. And
[15:54] uh yeah, it's just something to kind of
[15:56] mess around with here. So this is again
[15:58] real quick while while we're doing this
[15:59] is I sent in that message and then
[16:02] obviously it was on the front end at
[16:04] that point, right? But on the back end
[16:06] here, this is what you would be able to
[16:08] see either a real conversation like if
[16:10] you had, you know, if you hired chat um
[16:13] like support people, then they would be
[16:15] able to enter through here and say like
[16:17] like test whatever, you know, like say
[16:18] whatever like maybe maybe we could say
[16:20] like hello back or something like that
[16:22] and then say send here and let's see
[16:24] what we got on the front end. So now we
[16:26] have hello that was actually from me,
[16:28] right? So that's kind of cool, right? So
[16:29] you can have um also I'll move my face
[16:31] here real quick so you can kind of see
[16:32] this. This says like human down here and
[16:34] this says AI. Uh just kind of cool. I
[16:37] mean again the whole point here, the
[16:38] whole point that I'm trying to make with
[16:39] this is that if you're using email uh
[16:41] Bento for your email marketing platform
[16:43] already, it already has like all this
[16:45] stuff in here as opposed to you having
[16:46] to go find another live chat app or all
[16:49] these other things. This is in the AI
[16:52] CRM uh chat piece of the platform. I was
[16:55] about to move on to our last topic, but
[16:56] one last thing I had I had to tell you
[16:58] as I was navigating away from this page
[17:00] at the bottom here, I saw this little
[17:01] microphone and recording audio and I had
[17:04] to test it. It actually does work. It's
[17:06] pretty pretty It's pretty crazy. So,
[17:07] like you could actually send a voice
[17:09] memo back to your at least as of right
[17:11] now, you can send it back there. Uh I
[17:13] don't know why the uh I I don't think I
[17:16] can play this for you. I don't know why
[17:17] my voice got like super low, but uh it's
[17:22] you know it's it it works. It's pretty
[17:24] cool.
[17:24] >> Wow. This is pretty amazing. Does this
[17:26] actually work?
[17:27] >> Yeah. Not sure of that. Not sure why
[17:29] that happened, but you know, it is what
[17:30] it is. And uh you can send voice memos,
[17:31] too. It's pretty sick. All right. Last
[17:33] thing I want to cover here, and it is
[17:34] the most powerful, honestly, is the
[17:35] flows. Now, flows are like automations
[17:38] baked directly into your email marketing
[17:39] platform. There's a ton of different
[17:41] things in here. This is the most, you
[17:43] know, dense area of discussion in this
[17:45] entire platform. Uh the team at Bento
[17:48] has made such incredible stuff here. Uh,
[17:51] and it changes so often because they're
[17:52] always adding like new cool things here.
[17:55] I want to show you the lay of the land
[17:56] here in a way when you're like making
[17:57] this flow. So, obviously there's like a
[17:59] bunch of triggers in here and then
[18:00] there's actions, but obviously like
[18:02] we're in AI mode, so we're trying to,
[18:04] you know, we can like move things in
[18:06] and, you know, bring different stuff in
[18:08] and do whatever we want. But at the same
[18:09] time, like we could also just tell the
[18:11] thing what to do and get us at least,
[18:14] you know, 80% of the way there and then
[18:16] maybe tweak things if we need to. And
[18:17] right before that, I want to say as
[18:18] well, like noting this little thing here
[18:20] where it says ask a question about
[18:21] flows. We can ask the AI. It's it's kind
[18:24] of like a dual purpose. It can do things
[18:26] for us, but can also just answer
[18:27] questions for us. Can you tell me about
[18:30] flows and maybe recommend some that I
[18:33] should build first if I'm just setting
[18:35] up my account for the first time? So,
[18:37] with just that simple question, it's
[18:38] going to give me some information here.
[18:39] It's going to tell me like flows, AK
[18:41] automation, or bentos. If this happens,
[18:43] then do that engine. Um, you've probably
[18:45] seen this type of thing elsewhere
[18:47] obviously at this point. I mean, you've
[18:48] probably seen it externally, you know,
[18:49] with tools like Zapier, naden, make.com,
[18:52] etc. Uh, and you've probably seen it
[18:54] potentially in some other email
[18:55] marketing platforms that I would wager
[18:57] that you haven't seen it just like this,
[18:58] the way that you're able to again
[19:00] conversate and do all these different
[19:01] things. And it gave us some examples,
[19:02] too. So, like welcome and onboarding
[19:04] series, conversion cleanup,
[19:06] re-engagement, list hygiene, high intent
[19:08] page, support, feedback loop. I'm just
[19:11] going to come down here and say build a
[19:12] welcome series. Okay. Now, in less than
[19:14] 30 seconds, we have the bones of a
[19:16] welcome series ready to go here. Now,
[19:19] couple things. Again, as always, I
[19:21] wouldn't just say just use that and and
[19:23] just like press save and leave this
[19:25] because obviously it's not that was not
[19:26] a good enough prompt, nor was that
[19:28] enough time and energy devoted into
[19:29] this, but think about how long it would
[19:30] have taken you even just to drag all
[19:32] these in and do that stuff. So, it's at
[19:33] least at minimum a timesaver. And
[19:35] secondly, this is a different
[19:37] implementation of AI obviously than we
[19:38] saw earlier. Earlier in the in the
[19:40] broadcast and stuff, we saw like kind of
[19:42] glorified text implementations of AI
[19:45] just, you know, kind of natively, which
[19:46] is a nice thing. But this is a way more
[19:48] specialized use case of AI here where
[19:50] we're actually building within the UI of
[19:52] a particular app. We're not doing
[19:53] anything hokey where we're trying to
[19:55] like build use the AI somewhere else and
[19:57] then like export JSON data or some some
[20:00] other whatever format we need and then
[20:02] bring it in. This is literally all in
[20:03] here and it took, you know, less than a
[20:05] minute. And again, this isn't just for
[20:06] building them, it's for editing them,
[20:08] too. So, we have some steps in here.
[20:09] We're like waiting 3 days and we're
[20:11] waiting 7 days. I'm just going to try to
[20:13] say, hey, you know, on the first on the
[20:14] first delay, wait 5 days. On the second
[20:17] delay, wait 10 days. On the first delay,
[20:20] wait 5 days. On the second delay, wait
[20:22] 10 days. And just like that, we got that
[20:25] changed. So now the value is 5 days over
[20:28] here and it's 10 days over here. Now
[20:30] again, could I have just clicked in and
[20:31] done that? Yes. But like I could also
[20:32] give it like multiple things at one
[20:34] time. I think the whole point here is
[20:36] again if you haven't if you're not at
[20:37] this point in mindset wise like where
[20:39] the world is headed like you have to be
[20:41] more become more of an orchestrator an
[20:43] idea hver innovator a systems architect
[20:47] if you will uh rather than a button
[20:49] clicker you can still click buttons
[20:50] obviously but I just think that this is
[20:52] at least to me where I want to be
[20:54] because I can kind of pilot the system
[20:56] and then step in when needed rather than
[20:58] doing every single one of the individual
[21:01] pieces of leg work. I'm gonna try one
[21:02] more thing here just to kind of see how
[21:04] this works. Can you go ahead and delete
[21:06] all of the nodes?
[21:10] Boom. They're all gone. What I'm going
[21:11] to do is I'm going to take this second
[21:13] one that it gave us and I'm going to say
[21:15] like create this flow and boom, there we
[21:20] go. So, we have customer purchased or
[21:21] upgraded. Then we have, you know, tag
[21:23] them as a lead, tag them as a customer.
[21:26] Uh, now they're now we're sending them a
[21:28] welcome email and we're marking them as
[21:29] complete. Now again, go in here and make
[21:31] sure you're changing these things
[21:33] depending on like what is actually
[21:34] happening like whatever the the event
[21:36] is. In this case, it's like a generic,
[21:38] you know, just order paid situation. But
[21:40] if this is the first time you're seeing
[21:41] Vento, I can understand how you might
[21:43] not think that the platform itself is
[21:45] that powerful. This was not an in-depth
[21:47] tutorial on all that. So, I do
[21:48] apologize, but you can either take my
[21:50] word for it, or you can go sign up for
[21:51] the unlimited free trial. And once
[21:53] you're in there, you can go ahead and
[21:54] play around with any flows that you
[21:55] want. If you already have an email
[21:56] marketing platform, maybe it's a little
[21:58] lackluster. literally just come in here
[22:00] and see if you can rebuild them just
[22:01] like kind of starting with AI at least
[22:02] to get most of the way there and then
[22:04] tweak them when you need to. In any
[22:06] case, I hope you found this valuable. I
[22:07] talk about using AI to automate and
[22:09] improve business systems all the time.
