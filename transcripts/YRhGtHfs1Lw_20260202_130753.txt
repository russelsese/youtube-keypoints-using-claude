[00:00] You've heard of Claudebot. You've heard
[00:01] of Claude Code. You hear that people are
[00:04] unleashing crazy productivity gains, but
[00:06] you don't know how. In this episode, I'm
[00:09] going to show you a bunch of different
[00:11] use cases, 10 plus use cases for how to
[00:14] use CloudBot and how to use AI to be a
[00:17] way more productive person in your
[00:20] personal life and also in your business
[00:22] life. I brought in one of the craziest
[00:25] tinkerers on the planet to come on and
[00:28] he is at the forefront for using
[00:30] Claudebot for just pushing it to the
[00:33] extreme. And I just asked him, hey, can
[00:35] you come on the podcast and just show us
[00:37] how you're using it so other people
[00:40] could copy you? And he's got just the
[00:42] craziest setup. He even [music] has, you
[00:44] know, uh, one setup where he he DMs
[00:46] Kevin from the office, David Gogggins.
[00:50] He's got this crazy setup where these
[00:52] agents are helping him run his
[00:54] day-to-day life and [music] his wildly
[00:56] successful businesses. And it was just a
[00:58] treat uh to have him come on and see how
[01:01] he's pushing the edges. Uh by the end of
[01:03] this episode, you will have your
[01:05] creative juices flowing for how you can
[01:07] use CloudBot and how you can use AI to
[01:10] be an extremely productive person. Uh I
[01:13] don't think you can watch this and not
[01:15] be uh inspired for all the different uh
[01:19] use cases to integrate AI in your life.
[01:22] Enjoy the episode. [music]
[01:29] [music]
[01:32] >> Kits is a guy I've been following on the
[01:34] internet for a while. He seems like out
[01:36] of control, but he's got in a good way.
[01:39] He's he's he's one of my favorite
[01:40] followers when it comes to vibe coding.
[01:43] Kits, by the end of this episode, what
[01:45] are people tactically going to get uh
[01:48] take away from it? First of all, they're
[01:50] going to get severe ADHD. If you have
[01:52] it, welcome. If you don't have it,
[01:53] you're going to get it. What you're
[01:55] going to get is like a info dump and
[01:58] brain dump of like a gazillion
[01:59] productivity tips. We can try to stay on
[02:02] topic. That never works with me. That's
[02:04] why with Greg, we didn't plan any
[02:05] agenda. We didn't plan a title. We don't
[02:08] know what the title is going to be.
[02:09] We're going to talk about productivity,
[02:11] cloudbot, personal AI assistance,
[02:13] self-hosting,
[02:14] building a life OS, and a trillion other
[02:17] things.
[02:18] >> Dude, you're firing me up.
[02:19] >> Yeah, let's go.
[02:20] >> And let's go. Maybe we can start screen
[02:23] sharing. So, you you've intrigued me on
[02:25] this this idea around personal OS. I'm
[02:29] curious how you're using Cloudbot. Teach
[02:31] us
[02:32] >> teach us. We want the kids brain.
[02:34] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:36] I have a bunch of tabs here. I didn't
[02:38] prepare a bunch of notes. I have like a
[02:40] one note with things. My cloudbot is
[02:42] heavily personalized and I have like a
[02:45] tons of personal data right now. The
[02:46] last few days have been a roller
[02:47] coaster. So, we won't be able to
[02:49] interact with it, but we can go through
[02:52] all the things that I've done with it
[02:53] going from the tweets that I I have
[02:55] here. So, uh how I'm using Cloudboard
[02:59] right now, I'm just moving to a new
[03:00] workspace. Uh I'm using Discord
[03:02] basically. And as you can see here, I
[03:05] have like a one discord called kit and I
[03:07] have a one discord called zikit. Zikit
[03:08] is just like a flip on my name which is
[03:10] supposed to be the company discord. So
[03:13] what I have in cloudbot is like first of
[03:15] all there's like one gateway. So when
[03:17] you run cloudbot is like everyone else
[03:18] running cloudbot. I don't run multiple
[03:20] cloud bots. I have it running on my Mac
[03:21] studio and there's like one gateway that
[03:24] then to that gateway you can interface
[03:26] with telegram, iMessage, WhatsApp, your
[03:28] phone. I'm making a Ma glasses app right
[03:30] now to be able to connect through the Ma
[03:32] glasses and I'm in Telegram I made a
[03:36] couple of bots with different personas.
[03:38] I think this is crucial. So
[03:41] um every you can see in my discord here
[03:43] I have Gilfoil. So Gilfoil is a
[03:45] character from Silicon Valley for people
[03:46] that don't know and his skills and his
[03:49] abilities within my cloudbot are to be
[03:52] professional to be an engineer and he's
[03:54] equipped with all the skills to be an
[03:56] engineer like react native versell cooly
[03:58] managing SSH GitHub whatever he doesn't
[04:01] need to know about my home assistant
[04:02] doesn't need to know about my groceries
[04:04] and the other stuff then in my um in my
[04:07] personal telegram I have couple of
[04:09] personas that I made I think I have them
[04:11] somewhere in the in the open tweets and
[04:13] every persona is equipped with a
[04:14] different style of talking, different
[04:16] avatar, different name, and uh different
[04:19] skills. These are my personas. This is a
[04:22] group called Arkham Asylum. This is
[04:23] where I keep all of my bots. Uh David
[04:26] Gogggins, my fitness coach. He talks
[04:27] like David Gogins. He like swears, says
[04:29] all the things, trained on his
[04:31] personality, cares only about, they all
[04:34] care about my life, but about specific
[04:36] parts. We have Kevin, which is my
[04:38] accountant. I would say not a very good
[04:40] accountant cuz he's kind of down
[04:41] sometimes. Um, Dr. Cox, who cares about
[04:44] my health and stuff, so all the health
[04:46] stuff, I I don't have a screenshot of
[04:49] that, but I took all of my blood results
[04:50] and made like a UI for browsing my blood
[04:53] data and seeing what goes up, what goes
[04:55] down. And Dr. Cox is in charge of like
[04:57] only medical stuff. This is kind of
[04:59] gimmicky, but it's a nice separation
[05:01] because if you talk to only one bot all
[05:03] the time about everything, sometimes you
[05:05] cannot separate things out. So, you can
[05:06] just create multiple, give them fun
[05:08] personalities from TV shows, movies,
[05:09] whatever. And like Darlene is for
[05:12] example our home manager. So me and my
[05:14] wife and Darlene are in the family group
[05:17] and she will manage our entire home
[05:18] groceries, ordering stuff, um shopping
[05:21] list, whatever, whatever it is.
[05:23] >> So if someone sees this and is like I
[05:27] want to do something similar to this,
[05:29] could you give people just a little bit
[05:32] of how they can set up their own Kevin
[05:34] Malone, their own David Gogggins with
[05:36] within Cloudbot? Um, I would for for
[05:40] everyone who's been asking me stuff like
[05:41] my answer is like just ask your bot
[05:43] because that's the coolest thing, right?
[05:44] Like I didn't know how to make these
[05:46] personas. I asked on Discord. I asked on
[05:47] Twitter. I'm like [ __ ] it. I'll ask the
[05:49] bot. And the bot guides you through even
[05:51] clicks through the browser and helps you
[05:52] to to do these.
[05:54] >> The answer is this is like one cloudbot
[05:56] gateway. It just serves multiple
[05:58] personas.
[05:59] >> Perfect.
[06:01] So the cool thing about using Discord
[06:03] compared to Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack
[06:05] and whatever is uh you can group things
[06:07] into sections. So here as you can see
[06:09] like I I have nicely organized sections
[06:12] for everything. And within those
[06:14] sections you can have channels. Within
[06:16] the channels you can have uh help
[06:18] topics. So, as you can see here, if I go
[06:20] to customer threads, there's nothing now
[06:22] because I'm moving from my old Discord.
[06:24] But the idea is there is a customer's
[06:26] channel here where I would talk to my to
[06:30] Gilfoil or whoever about the customer
[06:31] support and they scrape my mail and they
[06:34] scrape my scrape or fetch it from API my
[06:36] DMs and anytime they find something
[06:38] related to my products, they would open
[06:40] a new post here and be like, "Hey, a
[06:42] customer is having like a billing issue.
[06:43] We select a billing issue, blah blah
[06:45] blah." they would put the post here and
[06:47] then a sub agent will immediately start
[06:48] processing that customer. But I only go
[06:51] in the into the forum if I care about
[06:53] individual customers. Most of the time I
[06:55] talk into the customers channel about
[06:57] customers in general. So I'll tell my
[06:59] bot and I've already done this. So hey
[07:02] find every customer who what the hell is
[07:04] that? Find every customer who had an
[07:06] issue with license activation and do
[07:09] this and that. So it's going to spawn
[07:10] all the threads. Uh you can see the
[07:12] thinking process. What is it doing for
[07:14] every customer? But I control it from
[07:15] one main thread.
[07:18] >> And you know, I just see the comment
[07:19] that someone's going to say uh right now
[07:21] like why is this better than just using
[07:25] cloud code or or another tool? Like why
[07:28] is it better to to have to have this
[07:31] setup over any other setup?
[07:34] >> I like I I'm honestly this last few days
[07:37] have been very tiring on Twitter. I've
[07:39] been battling people about this opinion
[07:41] and I got to a point where like [ __ ] it.
[07:43] If you don't see it, you don't see it.
[07:45] Like there are people who've been trying
[07:46] to shove this in people's faces like
[07:48] look at this. It's so productive. But
[07:50] for some people I think the FOMO is
[07:51] preventing them from seeing it clearly
[07:53] and they're going to find these nitpicks
[07:55] like oh I can just do this with cloud
[07:57] code. And the answer is like fine do it
[07:59] in the worst way. Like
[08:01] >> I don't know what I can say aside from
[08:03] everything we're going to say from this
[08:04] podcast. If someone listens to all of
[08:06] this and concludes that this is not
[08:08] worth it, there's nothing you can say to
[08:09] convince them.
[08:10] >> So, so your answer to that is stick with
[08:12] me. I'm going to show you I'm going to
[08:14] keep going and I'm going to show you why
[08:16] this is
[08:17] >> yes
[08:17] >> an extremely productive and optimized
[08:20] way
[08:21] >> to run your life and run your business.
[08:23] >> Yeah. Uh, another aspect is the
[08:25] self-learning part. I think for the
[08:27] first time people saw that how an AI can
[08:29] self-learn and learn new skills because
[08:31] for GPT and for cloud you got to install
[08:33] connectors and you got to go to a UI and
[08:36] they don't have access to your shell.
[08:37] this having access to your shell meaning
[08:40] you can tell it like I literally told it
[08:42] um find my printer and print something
[08:44] cool and it just found it on my network
[08:45] and it printed some asy art and it
[08:47] printed like a nice message for me or I
[08:49] was like find my uh I don't know
[08:51] displays that I have at home and through
[08:53] home assistant try to cast like a
[08:55] dashboard of my life so it figures out
[08:57] goes on the network goes to home
[08:58] assistant finds my TV makes an HTML
[09:00] dashboard and casts it on my TV like
[09:03] both chat chat GPT and claude like the
[09:05] UI don't have the ability to like
[09:08] self-learn and kind of find their way
[09:10] around limitations because this has
[09:12] literally access to your anything that
[09:14] you can do on your computer and on your
[09:15] network this can do it um too. So before
[09:20] we we uh before we wrap up about the the
[09:23] interface like another cool thing you
[09:25] can do uh in discord is basically these
[09:28] little things which are like it's not
[09:30] ideal but it's nice that you can start
[09:32] threads like within my skills. I have
[09:35] like a thread called Benji skill and
[09:36] once I'm done with it I am planning to
[09:39] close this one. So channels are staying
[09:41] forever. And threads are like something
[09:43] temporary like a task that we're working
[09:44] on or a skill that I'm adding or
[09:47] whatever and it's still not in the um in
[09:52] the core of Clawbot yet. It doesn't know
[09:54] how to create Discord threads. But you
[09:56] can just teach it and tell it, hey, you
[09:58] don't have it, but figure out the
[09:59] Discord API and start creating threads
[10:01] every time I add a to-do, let's say. So,
[10:03] Discord is compared to my interface that
[10:05] I showed you, Discord is the closest
[10:07] thing, especially if you make one for
[10:09] work and you make one for private and
[10:11] then you have like a nice um separation.
[10:14] >> Okay. So, good tip. Your recommendation
[10:16] is don't start with iMessage, Telegram
[10:21] when you're setting up Claudebot. Start
[10:23] with Discord.
[10:25] >> I would not say that for beginners to be
[10:27] honest. I would just say avoid WhatsApp
[10:28] because it's like the most finicky
[10:30] setup. Yeah.
[10:32] >> Um, I would say if you're a Telegram
[10:33] user, start with that. If you're not a
[10:36] Telegram user, what are you doing? Like
[10:37] I think anyone who texts me on like
[10:39] WhatsApp, Viber, whatever. Um, so
[10:42] actually iMessage or Telegram would be a
[10:44] good start to just feel the power of the
[10:46] bot to make it learn things, to make it
[10:47] learn skills, and it's less frictiony
[10:49] cuz not everyone wants Discord on their
[10:51] phone. Discord is like confusing for a
[10:53] lot of people. And most of the magic
[10:55] here is like you're you're able to take
[10:56] it with you on your phone. And I don't
[10:58] want like a like 15 Discord communities
[11:00] pinging my phone for for whatever. This
[11:02] would be the next step I would say.
[11:04] >> Okay. Step one, feel the magic. Step
[11:08] two, double down on the magic with
[11:10] Discord. Got it.
[11:11] >> Yes. Um, last thing I want to add on
[11:14] platforms before we move to something
[11:15] else is I haven't explored Slack yet.
[11:18] So, I'm still not I haven't set up a
[11:20] Slack, but a lot of people are familiar
[11:22] with the Slack interface for work. So I
[11:25] would say if you want to make like a
[11:26] worksp specific agent, most people would
[11:29] easily transition to Slack because they
[11:30] they've already used it and they know
[11:32] all the quirks and it actually has a
[11:34] bunch of features that other platforms
[11:36] might not have. So all of these like
[11:38] Telegram, Discord, Slack, they come with
[11:40] different benefits that you get in the
[11:42] one or don't get in the in the other.
[11:45] >> Cool. What's next?
[11:48] >> All right, let's see which tabs I have
[11:50] open here. I have no idea. This is the
[11:52] uh what? Yeah, canceling my missive
[11:55] subscription. So, missive has Let's talk
[11:56] about email because email is like a huge
[11:59] topic and people are actually getting
[12:01] their accounts hacked and stuff and
[12:03] people are scared because oh my god my
[12:04] email yesterday uh yesterday someone
[12:07] tried to um prompt inject my cloudbot
[12:11] for the first time because I'm a p I'm
[12:13] like I have followers my email is in a
[12:15] billion places and people of course are
[12:17] going to try to do that. So my advice
[12:20] first of all there would be like first
[12:21] of all if you're just starting don't
[12:23] even connect your email. I know one of
[12:24] the benefits is like read my email
[12:26] don't. Second of all while we're talking
[12:29] about security do not host it on a
[12:30] virtual private server whatever if you
[12:32] can host it on your own machine and
[12:34] dockerize it so it doesn't have access
[12:36] to everything. Start there and then
[12:38] slowly maybe open up cuz so many people
[12:40] thought it's going to be uh less scary
[12:42] to host it on a VPS and then they left
[12:45] ports exposed and they left a bunch of
[12:46] stuff vulnerable basically for someone
[12:48] to attack them. So if you don't know
[12:49] what you're doing, start with this.
[12:51] Dockerize no email access. If you give
[12:54] email access,
[12:56] uh do not use cheap models. So people
[12:57] are trying to save and Pete has been
[12:59] saying this in the discourse since day
[13:01] one that if you're trying to save even
[13:03] with Sonnet even like some people are
[13:04] using haiku or whatever like it's going
[13:06] to be stupid. It's going to be prompt
[13:08] injected and then you're [ __ ] because
[13:09] this has literally access can wipe your
[13:11] entire system, delete all of your
[13:12] emails, go to your GitHub, install
[13:14] malware, like it has your Apple
[13:16] credentials to deploy apps, whatever. So
[13:19] got to be careful what you give it
[13:20] access to. Um use like I prefer Opus
[13:23] most of the time um for this and codeex
[13:27] for coding. So um cloudbot can actually
[13:30] spawn sub aents that are specialized in
[13:32] coding. So I have a skill that tells it
[13:34] anytime you need to call code. You don't
[13:35] do it yourself. Spawn a sub agent that's
[13:38] using codeex because codeex is better
[13:40] for for coding. So regarding this tweet,
[13:43] I connected my email but I'm very
[13:45] careful about it. That's why I'm always
[13:46] using the smartest models and I don't
[13:48] have a web hook. Some people have this
[13:50] where every email immediately gets
[13:52] pinged into the bot and filter through
[13:53] the bot. That's stupid because then the
[13:55] bot just gets the email without any
[13:57] context and then it might follow the
[13:59] instructions in the email like send me
[14:00] my bank account credentials or whatever.
[14:02] So if you do it, I would do it where you
[14:05] tell the bot or it's on a chron job
[14:07] periodically doing something with your
[14:08] email but not um getting every email and
[14:12] processing every email. Even though I
[14:14] tried yesterday like I took the prompt
[14:16] injection, I tried to put it myself into
[14:17] my cloudbot and it laughed and it was
[14:19] like no I'm not falling for this. So
[14:23] um Opus is actually careful to an
[14:25] extreme point. Like I've given it a
[14:27] phone number. I bought a phone number
[14:28] with Twilio and a couple days ago I
[14:30] wanted to test it. I was like um I'm not
[14:32] going to set an alarm. You wake me up at
[14:33] 8:30 and it set a task to call me and
[14:36] then I wake up later. Of course the
[14:37] alarm didn't work. It didn't call me and
[14:39] I go on my phone and it says haha I'm
[14:41] not falling for this. You don't wake up
[14:42] this early. So uh I'm not falling for
[14:45] someone's prompt injection who wants to
[14:46] wake you up so early. So even when you
[14:49] give it the instructions it's like
[14:50] insanely careful to not be if some I
[14:53] think the more it evolves the more it's
[14:54] going to learn from its memory. The more
[14:56] it's going to learn about you and it
[14:58] will know whether you would do something
[15:00] as stupid as asking for your bank
[15:02] credentials over email etc. I mean
[15:04] prompt injections will evolve also but
[15:06] got to be careful there. So is your
[15:08] vision for the future that customer
[15:10] support maybe in like three, four, five
[15:12] years, 99% of it is handled via a cloud.
[15:17] >> Like what are you talking there's no 5
[15:18] years. There's no three years. I don't
[15:20] want to sound like a doomer. We're going
[15:21] back to my previous track record. In
[15:23] 2017, I had a slide before AI was
[15:25] mentioned. I had a slide saying in the
[15:27] future front-end development will look
[15:29] like managers and hired people in the
[15:31] company will talk to a voice assistant
[15:33] and they will say what they want and the
[15:35] browser will show them what they want.
[15:37] which means all the layers in the
[15:39] company are going to thin out unless we
[15:40] get to like couple of people. So I said
[15:42] this like more than 10 years ago and
[15:44] it's now unfolding. So when I say like
[15:47] you see all of these doomer and meme
[15:48] takes like you got to make money before
[15:50] we go into the permanent underclass and
[15:52] blah blah blah not customer support not
[15:55] it overall or programming whatever
[15:57] everything is toast within a year or two
[15:59] and just to put a little asterisk there
[16:02] the toast means if you're not an
[16:05] equipped person who's on the forefront
[16:06] of AI and you're not gathering your
[16:09] skills and you don't come to work with
[16:11] your army of agents the 18year-old who
[16:14] just studied Cloudbot and all of these
[16:16] things and it just loaded up with skills
[16:18] and stuff. It's going to absolutely
[16:19] destroy you. So, there's going to be
[16:23] people remaining within layers of the
[16:24] company, but it's going to be like a
[16:26] virus spreading like one cracked kid
[16:28] coming with all of their agents,
[16:29] replacing three engineers, and then just
[16:31] moving up, moving up, moving up until
[16:32] you don't need that many people to form
[16:34] like your own business.
[16:37] >> Yeah. Yeah. And I think we're starting
[16:38] to see that on on, you know, we Amazon
[16:41] today, I think, is laying off 15,000
[16:43] employees. Pinterest, I think, just laid
[16:46] off up to 15% of their employees. So,
[16:50] uh, all within the name of, uh,
[16:52] optimization and AI. So, I think, um,
[16:56] the big companies even are realizing
[16:57] like, hey, we can do a lot more with a
[17:00] lot less. So, um, that's why I'm
[17:02] interested in learning. like, you know,
[17:04] I'm interested in learning cuz I'm
[17:05] trying to be I want to be the most
[17:07] productive person I could be.
[17:08] >> Yes. Yeah. And I think Cloudbot is like
[17:11] the
[17:13] >> um the final unlock in this um glue,
[17:16] let's call it. I don't know how to call
[17:17] it, like the ultimate tool that can
[17:20] speedrun the rest of your automations
[17:22] and the rest of your learning skills,
[17:23] whatever.
[17:24] >> Anything else you wanted to show in
[17:26] terms of use cases?
[17:29] >> I [clears throat] mean, we just got
[17:30] started. There's like 70 tabs left and
[17:31] my voice is already gone.
[17:33] Yeah, we can keep it shorter on on each
[17:36] one of the topics um just so we can show
[17:39] more stuff. So,
[17:42] as I [clears throat] said from email
[17:43] classification, I'm canceling my email
[17:44] subscription because I don't need to
[17:46] look at my email anymore. It's handled
[17:48] by the bots. They're doing chron jobs.
[17:49] They're doing whatever. I don't want to
[17:50] look at my email. I want to interface
[17:52] with my email through chat and I don't
[17:54] ever want to look at it. Period. Um we
[17:56] can wrap this one up or you want to ask
[17:57] something about emails and stuff?
[17:58] >> Yeah, let's wrap it up.
[18:01] I want to do like lightning round like
[18:02] boom boom. Let's do a lightning round.
[18:06] [clears throat]
[18:06] >> This one is a cool addition.
[18:09] A lot of people haven't heard of this.
[18:10] It's called anti-capture.com and you're
[18:12] you're paying a small subscription. I
[18:14] think you can start with $5 for human
[18:16] workers. I don't know how ethical is
[18:18] this. I don't condone it. I've tried it.
[18:20] I haven't implemented it yet, but it
[18:22] works behind the scenes. This exists for
[18:24] years, by the way. when you want
[18:25] automation, but the bots are stuck on
[18:27] capture, there's a human somewhere which
[18:29] is going to solve your capture for like
[18:30] 0 point whatever dollars they're they're
[18:32] paying them. So, as I said, I don't know
[18:33] how ethical it is, but if you equip your
[18:35] bot with this, it will basically never
[18:37] get stuck in capture. Even though my
[18:40] cloud bot surprised me yesterday, it was
[18:42] booking a flight for me and it was like,
[18:44] "Oh, what are these?" Oh, brooms. Cool.
[18:45] I selected all the brooms and it just
[18:46] moved on casually. You know, it wasn't
[18:49] stuck on the capture at all. So, this
[18:50] one is a is a cool service. Next one.
[18:55] Yeah, let's do it.
[18:56] >> Um, this is pretty cool and this is
[18:58] going to be a thing. I don't know if
[18:59] you've seen uh smart rings which are
[19:01] coming out. Not fitness rings, but like
[19:03] AI rings are coming out.
[19:05] >> I actually haven't seen this.
[19:07] >> Well, time to get people into another
[19:09] rabbit hole. Um, cuz there's like three
[19:12] there's a Kickstarter, there's like one
[19:14] more company, and there's Pebble. I
[19:16] don't know if you know what Pebble got
[19:17] resurrected. The smartwatch company.
[19:18] They're now issuing their own watch. Uh
[19:20] it's like some ridiculous price like $60
[19:23] or $70 or something like this. The only
[19:25] problem is like it doesn't the battery
[19:27] is not rechargeable and it's going to
[19:28] die in like 5 years or whatever. But
[19:30] probably all of us will so that's why it
[19:32] won't matter. Um, it has a cool button
[19:34] on it. And I think this paired with the
[19:37] Ma glasses or this paired with your
[19:39] AirPods and whatever is the missing
[19:41] interface to like super hyper
[19:42] productivity because as you can see in
[19:45] the picture, he's intentionally wearing
[19:46] it on this finger, which you have access
[19:47] to all the time. And I usually do to-dos
[19:51] and other stuff through my watch. So I
[19:53] have this button on the Ultra set up to
[19:55] go to Benji. And anytime I dictate
[19:57] something, like Benji figures out
[19:58] whether it's a to-do, whether it's a
[20:00] habit and does something with it. Now,
[20:02] it's going to be switched to Cloudbot,
[20:03] but this basically has an API and it
[20:05] just has a microphone. You say whatever,
[20:07] a voice note, a memo, whatever, and they
[20:09] store it in their phone app through
[20:11] Bluetooth and then you have an API to
[20:13] send it wherever you want, which is
[20:14] going to be mental cuz you can use it to
[20:17] from controlling your lights to talking
[20:19] with your bot about customers and
[20:22] whatever. Like, it's going to be the new
[20:23] superpower for like creating magic from
[20:25] your wrist. So, couple of months until
[20:29] it arrives and then we're going to see
[20:30] what's going on
[20:31] >> and then we'll review it on the channel.
[20:33] >> Yeah, absolutely. This is super cool.
[20:36] >> Next up, this is cool. Um, and this was
[20:40] self taught. This was one of the other
[20:41] skills that Claude Claudebot learned uh
[20:45] to C to make like you cannot cast HTML
[20:49] dashboard to uh Google Home without a
[20:52] lot of hacks and stuff. But it figured
[20:54] out a workaround. It made the page,
[20:56] screenshotted it as an image and just
[20:58] casted the actual image on it. So now
[21:01] anytime it needs to grab my attention or
[21:02] whatever, it can actually cast to one of
[21:05] my devices at home. And on the right, I
[21:08] don't know if you know this device, it's
[21:09] called terminal TRM, whatever they have
[21:12] like a short name or something.
[21:13] >> TRM NL.
[21:15] >> Yeah, it's like a e- in device. It's
[21:17] completely programmable. So of course,
[21:18] Cloudbot just asked for my API token.
[21:20] and I give it and now anytime it can
[21:23] display things from my life OS from my
[21:24] automations it can grab my attention it
[21:26] can paint pictures it can do whatever so
[21:29] this is like where I see this heading
[21:31] like where I want to head with my smart
[21:32] home which is not so smart right now is
[21:35] I'm adding small presence sensors in all
[21:38] of my rooms which detect the Apple Watch
[21:40] and basically the Apple Watch knows in
[21:42] which room you are at any given time and
[21:44] it's instant like it it can even know
[21:46] the difference whether I'm sitting on my
[21:47] desk or whether I'm close to where the
[21:49] sensor
[21:50] And what I'm planning because home
[21:52] assistant has access to all of this
[21:53] info. Anytime I talk to Cloudbot, it's
[21:56] going to get a small prompt injected
[21:57] with my GPS location like whether I'm
[21:59] home or away and my room. So when I'm in
[22:02] a room and I say something to my ring or
[22:04] whatever, it will know the context. Aha,
[22:06] he's at home in the room. I know what
[22:07] he's asking me to do. Which all of these
[22:10] voice assistants are completely useless
[22:12] when it comes to to that. They're just
[22:13] like set a timer or whatever. Please
[22:16] don't.
[22:17] >> Yeah.
[22:17] >> Yeah. So, so where all of this is going
[22:19] is like I I see the home becoming part
[22:22] of the smartness like TV's lighting up,
[22:25] dashboards catching your attention
[22:26] because you're missing you're late to a
[22:28] meeting so your TV lights up with a red
[22:30] image blinking like clockbot can run all
[22:32] of that but until now we didn't have the
[22:34] glue like how to how to make that work.
[22:36] >> So So what you're saying basically is
[22:38] this whole you know smartarthome concept
[22:41] hasn't actually been that smart.
[22:43] basically just been devices connected to
[22:46] the internet and relying on humans to
[22:48] actually pull the levers to do things.
[22:50] What you're saying is basically
[22:53] >> uh we're entering an era where the true
[22:56] smart home will exist.
[22:58] >> Absolutely.
[22:58] >> And and the glue is going to be devices
[23:02] like the Pebble Ring or whatever you
[23:04] know our competitors.
[23:06] >> Yeah.
[23:07] >> And Cloudbot and and products like
[23:09] Cloudbot.
[23:11] There's going to be a huge split between
[23:13] consumer AI and tinkerers. That's why I
[23:16] formed the the Tinker Club. I hope we're
[23:18] going to link it somewhere or something
[23:19] or people can find it out. Like these
[23:21] tinkerers, they want to glue together a
[23:22] Pebble watch with their self-hosted home
[23:25] assistant casted on their dashboard with
[23:27] their weird headphones and CLI,
[23:29] whatever.
[23:30] >> And there's going to be most of
[23:31] consumers who are just going to keep
[23:33] iterating and using GPT whatever GP is
[23:36] going to throw at them. like GP will
[23:37] eventually classify your email and cloud
[23:39] will eventually do your like whatever
[23:41] they connect to Apple Health and
[23:42] whatever. But I think these days with
[23:45] cloudbot tinkerers saw this opportunity
[23:47] like [ __ ] it. I want to run my own AI.
[23:49] I'm going to spend 1020,000 at home buy
[23:51] a beefy graphics cards whatever it's
[23:54] needed to run um local AI. I'm going to
[23:56] own my assistant. I'm going to own my
[23:58] data and I don't want to rely on the
[24:00] cloud or outages or nerfing the models
[24:02] or whatever. So, there's going to be a
[24:03] giant split and this will never hit the
[24:05] mainstream to a point where my mom is
[24:07] using Clawbot with her Pebble ring, you
[24:10] know.
[24:10] >> Totally. Let's do four more.
[24:14] >> Four more.
[24:17] Um, let's see what else we have. Yeah,
[24:20] YouTube doesn't make you let you make
[24:22] playlist from children's songs, which is
[24:24] very stupid. So, we want to have a
[24:25] playlist of all the songs my daughter is
[24:27] listening to. YouTube cannot do it. So I
[24:29] just told my cloudbot to install a skill
[24:31] for downloading YouTube videos. Uh we
[24:33] sent screenshots from Spotify from which
[24:34] songs we playing to my daughter and from
[24:36] YouTube music. It found them on YouTube,
[24:38] downloaded all of them, connected to my
[24:40] NAS, hosted them on Plex and now on
[24:42] Plex, we have a nice playlist with
[24:44] cleaned up names, titles, whatever with
[24:46] all the songs that that are needed uh to
[24:48] play to my daughter. So that one is
[24:50] pretty cool. Here we showcase like you
[24:52] can connect to your NAS, you can connect
[24:53] to your home assistant, you can connect
[24:55] to anything and just interface through
[24:56] through chat. uh more pi hole like ad
[25:01] blocking. Uh I was always like I'm a
[25:03] tinkerer but I was always too lazy to
[25:04] set this up. Now I just told this like
[25:06] hey I have a spare mech studio laying
[25:08] around. It's going to be plugged in all
[25:10] all the time. How about you set up Pi
[25:12] Hole and block ads on my entire network.
[25:14] So, in a couple of iterations, we got
[25:15] this and now all my devices, my wife's
[25:18] device, whatever, like 92% of the ads
[25:20] are going to be blocked and there's
[25:22] going to be no no ads, which is this is
[25:25] an example where someone who's like,
[25:26] I've been tinkering with way weirder
[25:28] stuff like I was just lazy to do certain
[25:30] things, you know? I want to text and
[25:32] create magic and that's it. Skill for
[25:34] making a scaly draws. This
[25:35] >> Oh, are you kidding me? I need this,
[25:37] bro.
[25:37] >> Yeah, escal
[25:39] format for Excaliraw is JSON. So
[25:42] basically you can tell it to make a JSON
[25:44] file, host it on your own network,
[25:46] expose it to the internet and open
[25:48] Excaliraw with the JSON loaded. So it
[25:51] just gives you a link if you teach it
[25:52] right. It just gives you a link. You
[25:54] click the link and you can iterate on
[25:55] your Excali draw from your cloudbot
[25:57] which is very nice.
[25:59] >> Super nice.
[26:00] >> Yeah, this is some of my [laughter]
[26:03] architecture. helpful for your own
[26:05] personal stuff, like getting ideas out.
[26:07] Helpful for content,
[26:09] >> like you want to like screenshot that,
[26:11] throw it out to X, and also helpful if
[26:13] you're doing like YouTube videos like
[26:14] this and you want to share stuff.
[26:16] >> I think this is the point where a lot of
[26:18] people are going to break their monitor
[26:19] and be like, "Oh, come on, guy." Cuz
[26:21] yes, I took things too far with
[26:23] Cloudbot. I gave it all of my bank
[26:26] transactions since 2023. So I went to my
[26:28] banks, manually exported the CSVs for
[26:30] everything. And I was like, what cool
[26:32] things can I do with all of my banking
[26:34] data? So first of all, I did the classic
[26:36] find my subscriptions, biggest cost,
[26:37] blah blah blah. But then I'm like, I'm
[26:39] spending a lot on the dentist. Can you
[26:40] like find all my emails from the dentist
[26:42] and find all my bank transactions from
[26:44] the dentist and make me like a visual in
[26:47] my life like from which tooth are we
[26:50] working on next, what have I paid for,
[26:52] where do I have implants, and match the
[26:54] prices. So it did this crazy UI not on
[26:56] the first try and now I can see what's
[26:59] upcoming next. If I ever go to a dentist
[27:01] in another country I can just open my
[27:02] life west and be like oh this is what I
[27:04] have done cuz it pulls from my all of my
[27:07] data. This is absolutely insane.
[27:09] >> What am I looking at right now?
[27:11] >> Um I'm making this like I made it when
[27:13] GPT came out. Now I'm remaking it. It's
[27:15] called Spellbook. It's basically like a
[27:17] market. It's not a marketplace yet but
[27:19] it's a place for prompts with a twist.
[27:22] And the twist is for example you can see
[27:24] some of like I'll try to keep most of my
[27:27] prompts public for example I have my
[27:29] prompts for codebased to marketing
[27:30] material for a landing page or uh
[27:33] codebased marketing to a to a landing
[27:35] page. Uh the cool thing and how is it
[27:37] different than other thing is like you
[27:39] have these variables here. So when
[27:40] someone tries to use the prom for
[27:42] example this they'll get a nice UI. So
[27:44] let's say I give you my prom for making
[27:46] swift apps. Instead of you changing
[27:48] stuff from here, you can actually go
[27:50] here and say the purpose of the app is
[27:52] we're creating I don't know like a sleep
[27:54] tracker. The name is sleepy. Do we want
[27:56] licensing or not? Do we want to show it
[27:58] in the tray? Do we want to show it in
[28:00] the dock? We can say like in the dock
[28:01] it's configurable. And do we want
[28:03] onboarding? So now the doc is the prompt
[28:06] is ready and I can copy it in chatd,
[28:08] copy it in cloud or just copy it and
[28:09] just dump it in whatever app I'm using.
[28:14] So it's like a snippets prompt
[28:16] organizer. It has a desktop app. You can
[28:17] invoke it with a shortcut and it's very
[28:20] useful both in coding both in
[28:23] >> any AI workflow nowadays. You need your
[28:25] prompts to invoke them. Type in
[28:27] variables, press enter. It's completely
[28:29] free. Um you can sign up and you can
[28:31] check it out for for free.
[28:35] >> I think it will be useful. I think uh I
[28:37] think we're out of time, but dude,
[28:39] you're everything I dreamed of and more,
[28:42] you know, like when I'm reading your
[28:44] tweets, I I can feel the the manic ADHD
[28:48] vibes.
[28:49] >> And I love that. I I I love it. Um
[28:52] because I feel like you're learning in
[28:53] real time and you're just like sharing
[28:55] like no filter. Um so for me, this this
[28:59] pod exceeded expectations.
[29:01] >> Uh and I really appreciate it. could
[29:05] say, um, I'm going to include places
[29:08] for,
[29:09] uh, where people can follow you in the
[29:11] show notes, in the description. Um, some
[29:13] of your projects. Um, is there anything
[29:16] [clears throat] else you want to leave
[29:16] people with? Um, last thing I want to
[29:19] leave people with is like, if you don't
[29:22] open your mind right now to everything
[29:24] that's happening, just because you're
[29:26] skeptical about it and you push it away,
[29:28] it doesn't mean that this revolution
[29:30] won't happen. This year will be
[29:32] absolutely crazy. People are complaining
[29:34] in my DMs, how do I cope with it? How do
[29:35] I this? How do I that? The only ways to
[29:38] embrace it, to embrace the speed and
[29:40] know that LLMs won't be uninvented.
[29:42] We're never going to go back. The bubble
[29:44] is not going to pop. It's only going to
[29:46] go faster and faster. And the listen to
[29:48] Greg's podcast like educate yourself.
[29:51] The more skilled you are, the bigger the
[29:52] chances you're going to be employed,
[29:53] make money, and whatever. You can cut it
[29:56] out if you want, but we made this
[29:57] tinkerer club, which is like for ADHD
[29:59] people like me. It already filled with
[30:01] couple hundred people. There's like
[30:03] there's too much noise everywhere. Like
[30:05] Twitter is too noisy. The Clawbot
[30:06] Discord is too noisy. I wanted one tight
[30:08] community where we discuss all of these
[30:10] things. So if you ever want to join
[30:11] that, you can. Maybe we can even give
[30:13] some discount code through your podcast
[30:15] or whatever. And my DMs are open. If you
[30:17] ever need like help or questions about
[30:19] anything, you can also ask me there
[30:21] >> 100%. And I re I totally recommend
[30:24] following you. Um, we'll include the
[30:26] link to Tinkerers Club for people
[30:28] interested in the in the description.
[30:30] And, uh, if you want more content like
[30:33] this in your feed, um, go ahead and
[30:35] like, comment, and subscribe. Um, and,
[30:40] uh, I'll keep, uh, I'll keep sharing
[30:42] sharing interesting people. Bring them
[30:44] on the pod if you keep enjoying it. So,
[30:46] thanks again, Kitsay, for coming on to
[30:49] the podcast, for being a legend, for
[30:51] tinkering like there is no tomorrow, and
[30:54] uh for sharing a lot of sauce. Thank you
[30:55] so much.
[30:56] >> Thank you for having me, man. I
[30:57] appreciate it.
