[00:00] I was actually pulling in more so 80
[00:02] hours a work week. And especially with
[00:04] small businesses, you don't have the
[00:06] luxury of time. You don't really have
[00:08] the luxury of getting it wrong. And so I
[00:11] revamped that.
[00:12] >> That's Ashley Gross, the marketing ops
[00:14] leader who's not just streamlining
[00:15] workflows. She's architecting AI systems
[00:18] that eliminate the work no one wants to
[00:20] do. From building multi-agent automation
[00:22] stacks to reducing her own workload by
[00:25] 60% without sacrificing quality,
[00:27] Ashley's turning AI into a daily
[00:30] operating system, not just a distant
[00:32] strategy. Recognized by Forbes as one of
[00:34] the highest paid AI consultants. She's
[00:36] teaching agencies how to do the same one
[00:39] micro workflow at a time. But how does
[00:40] she do it?
[00:41] >> I built 11 agents that now do 80% of my
[00:44] operational muscles. They are doing all
[00:46] of the least glamorous, sexy jobs that
[00:48] you can imagine so that I'm not just
[00:50] running around like a chicken with my
[00:51] head cut off as as a solo founder.
[00:53] >> In this episode, you'll learn how to
[00:55] automate 20 to 25 hours of weekly busy
[00:57] work with simple AI workflows you can
[01:00] set up in one day.
[01:01] >> All my agents talk to each other. They
[01:02] are very much built into my organization
[01:05] charts. Full-time, part-time, maybe some
[01:06] [music] contractor.
[01:07] >> How to turn AI agents into your first
[01:09] full-time digital employee. As a small
[01:12] business owner, I am losing deals when
[01:14] I'm sleeping. So, having an AI agent
[01:16] that not only answers those questions,
[01:17] but also qualifies those leads and then
[01:20] going so far as to book that on my
[01:22] calendar has been the craziest concept
[01:25] for me.
[01:26] >> How small businesses can operate like
[01:27] enterprises using agentic workflows,
[01:30] automations, and new AI augmented rules.
[01:33] >> What used to be a milliondoll advantage
[01:35] is now available for $75 a month.
[01:42] with your business, you know, you know,
[01:44] I read you've taken, you know, what used
[01:47] to be a tasks that you would do and jobs
[01:50] that taking 40 hours a week are down to
[01:53] like 15 hours now. What is the craziest
[01:56] thing that you've seen AI automate
[02:00] perform either in your business or any
[02:02] of your clients? This is not the the
[02:04] craziest one, but I would say the the
[02:06] most frequent one that I have I started
[02:10] with myself and my own business and now
[02:12] I'm recreating for my clients um is the
[02:16] AI agent that is online all night long
[02:19] because most chat bots are glorified FAQ
[02:23] pages. You ask a question, you get an
[02:25] answer, and then nothing. And so I built
[02:27] an AI agent and and I built them now for
[02:29] my clients that actually executes. So,
[02:32] not only can I sleep, because as a small
[02:35] business owner, um I am losing deals
[02:37] when I'm sleeping. So, every minute of
[02:39] my time that I'm sitting sleeping, like
[02:41] there is there are deals that I'm
[02:43] losing. And that's just the reality of
[02:45] being a small business owner. Um and it
[02:47] doesn't make sense to have someone hang
[02:50] out all night long on the computer and
[02:51] like potentially wait for a question or
[02:53] like maybe not receive any questions at
[02:55] all. And so having an AI agent that not
[02:57] only answers those questions, but also
[02:59] qualifies those leads that that are
[03:01] asking those questions to see like are
[03:03] they just digging around? Um what does
[03:05] their IP address say? Like what is their
[03:08] intent in this conversation? and then
[03:10] going so far as to book that on my
[03:12] calendar has been the craziest concept
[03:15] for me because the way that this was
[03:17] designed is all of my SOPs, all my
[03:20] SLAs's, pretty much every question that
[03:21] anyone has ever asked me lives inside of
[03:24] my Google Drive and Notion. And so I
[03:28] every time I get asked a new question, I
[03:29] add to that database. So I already have
[03:31] a ton of questions, a ton of answers, a
[03:33] ton of resources. And so what I did was
[03:35] I connected that to AI and I created a
[03:38] persona. Uh, I made her incredibly
[03:40] friendly and I gave her the rules and
[03:43] parameters that she could only answer
[03:46] questions from my list of questions and
[03:49] she could only answer them in the way
[03:51] that I provided her with documentation
[03:54] for. And so if you go on my website
[03:56] after hours and you ask a question in
[03:59] the chatbot, you knowingly click chat
[04:01] now. You ask your question and then she
[04:04] appears and answers them. And then if
[04:06] you want to have a more fluid
[04:08] conversation, uh, a synthetic human
[04:10] interaction, if you will, you can
[04:12] actually click the dial button and talk
[04:14] to her. So instead of just typing back
[04:15] and forth, which we've kind of become
[04:17] accustomed to hate, you can just jump on
[04:19] a video call with her and she'll answer
[04:21] your questions live. And as she's doing
[04:24] this, she's asking you questions such
[04:27] as, "Hey, I see that you're interested
[04:29] in consulting courses and you had a
[04:31] question about uh how how this works
[04:33] with Ashley's workshops. who is your
[04:35] audience that you would like this
[04:36] workshop to be with? And as they're
[04:38] answering her in real time, she's
[04:40] updating my CRM. So, she's creating a
[04:42] contact, updating the CRM, pulling that
[04:45] information and enriching it and looking
[04:46] at signals such as when is their fiscal
[04:49] year if they're public. Uh, look through
[04:51] all of their social media platforms that
[04:53] are public and tell me um what their uh
[04:56] interpretation of AI is and what their
[04:58] sentiment is and then show me three
[04:59] posts that they've posted or reposted
[05:01] that that link to that sentiment. So,
[05:04] she's not only answering their questions
[05:06] in real time, but she's gathering intent
[05:07] to see, are they just asking? Is this a
[05:10] middle of the night crusade where
[05:11] they're just, you know, on the internet
[05:13] or are they actually interested in
[05:14] something? And this happens to be the
[05:16] one moment uh as a business owner, as a
[05:18] CMO, as a CFO that they get to do some
[05:21] research. And right now, we need to
[05:22] answer them and get them on the
[05:24] calendar. And if so, she offers them uh
[05:28] to book on my calendarly. And not only
[05:30] does she say, you know, hey, Ashley's
[05:33] got availability tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[05:34] Would you like to book? She'll book it
[05:36] for them. And that's a much cleaner user
[05:38] experience than just giving a calendarly
[05:40] booking because if we got them in the
[05:42] middle of the night and they actually
[05:43] are one of our ideal customers, then we
[05:48] don't want any time to go by and we
[05:49] don't want to make their journey of
[05:51] getting to us any more complicated. So,
[05:53] we don't want to give them a link and
[05:54] make them click and fill out a form. We
[05:56] just want them to say yes. And so she's
[05:58] essentially doing what a sales rep would
[06:00] do in the middle of the night and giving
[06:03] them my next availability and almost
[06:04] kind of saying this is her next
[06:06] availability. So I hope it works for
[06:07] you. Does it? If not, I can look at the
[06:09] next one. But she books that pretty
[06:10] quick. Now we're creating this FOMO,
[06:12] this urgency after hours. And if they
[06:15] say yes, she books them. The enriched
[06:18] contact information, including the call
[06:20] transcript of that interaction, is in my
[06:22] CRM and I have an email. So when I wake
[06:25] up, it's like I can just debrief myself
[06:27] on what happened and look forward to
[06:29] that next call. If you're an agency that
[06:31] serves local businesses, this is an easy
[06:33] service to add. Let me show you how
[06:35] agencies set up an AI receptionist for
[06:37] clients. Everything starts in one place.
[06:39] You drop in the details the receptionist
[06:41] needs to know, services, pricing,
[06:43] availability, qualifications, and the
[06:45] questions customers ask every day. Next,
[06:47] you define how that receptionist should
[06:49] behave on every call. You control the
[06:51] greeting, the questions it asks, how it
[06:53] qualifies leads, and how it closes. So,
[06:55] it follows your client's exact [music]
[06:57] process. It can even book appointments
[06:59] directly into the client's calendar. If
[07:01] a call needs a human, you can set up
[07:03] transfers to the right phone lines,
[07:04] sales support, or the client's front
[07:06] desk. Then, you connect it to the tools
[07:08] you already manage for your clients,
[07:09] your CRM, scheduling links, lead forms,
[07:12] so every call becomes a complete
[07:14] workflow, not just a conversation. And
[07:16] because it's fully connected, the AI can
[07:18] automatically follow up by text. so no
[07:20] leads fall through the cracks. This is
[07:22] how agencies deliver AI call handling at
[07:25] scale, whether it's for one client or
[07:27] hundreds. Build an AI receptionist for
[07:29] your clients with Vendasta.
[07:31] >> To look under the hood with, you know,
[07:33] some of the other parts of your your
[07:35] enterprise, where do you have other
[07:36] little gremlins working and what types
[07:38] of jobs are they doing?
[07:39] >> They are um very much built into my
[07:42] organization chart. So, whenever you're
[07:44] talking about preai times, if you will,
[07:47] if we can even remember what that was
[07:48] like, the way you structure your
[07:50] employees is, you know, full-time,
[07:52] part-time, maybe some contractors, maybe
[07:54] some freelance workers. That's no
[07:55] different than how you structure AI
[07:58] agents, right? Like your ability as a
[08:00] leader to decide how many hours and what
[08:03] type of employees should be in which
[08:04] role uh to enhance their own abilities,
[08:07] like that is a leadership skill set. And
[08:08] so I'm using AI agents to do everything
[08:11] that I don't want my humans focusing on.
[08:13] So they're doing things like uh going
[08:16] through every single contract that we've
[08:18] ever had, making sure that if there's um
[08:21] old branding or old addresses, phone
[08:23] numbers, that we have like an audit
[08:25] running so that we know when to update,
[08:28] you know, our NDAs and our contracts.
[08:30] They're doing things like cleaning up
[08:32] our CRM, making sure that there's not
[08:34] duplicates. Uh anytime that we are
[08:38] getting ready to have uh an upsell with
[08:42] a client, like anytime there's a
[08:43] contract that's about to be up for
[08:45] renewal, uh there's an agent
[08:46] specifically that the whole entire year
[08:49] leading up to that renewal, every email,
[08:52] every call transcript, every contract,
[08:55] every agreement, it's got like a
[08:56] relationship database on every single
[08:58] client we have down to a person at that
[09:00] organization so that we know like six
[09:02] months before the renewal what our
[09:04] talking points are, how to actually get
[09:06] that renewal, if we can upsell, what
[09:08] does that look like, how do we talk to
[09:10] these folks? Um, and then also not just
[09:12] like how to do it, but what we've done
[09:14] in the past. And so my favorite thing
[09:16] about this agent is it will site all of
[09:18] the different calls where if it's the
[09:20] CFO who's the main stakeholder, it will
[09:22] pull the last year's worth of calls
[09:24] where he had a really good uh experience
[09:26] with us or he had really great
[09:27] sentiments or he was paying us a
[09:29] compliment about something that we did.
[09:31] so that not only are we getting our own
[09:33] answer and we're proactively having
[09:36] these conversations and managing
[09:38] relationships better, but we don't have
[09:39] to be as reactive, right? Like there's
[09:41] never a a surprise that happens to this
[09:43] point in time where um someone's not
[09:46] happy, right? Because like we have a
[09:47] happiness meter and that's one of the AI
[09:49] agents jobs is to have a happiness meter
[09:51] and to keep a check on that because I
[09:53] don't want my humans to be stressing out
[09:55] about every email and reading in between
[09:56] the lines and saying well George the CFO
[09:59] usually sends me these nice Friday
[10:00] emails but today his was short. Does he
[10:02] hate us? Is he going to cancel our
[10:03] contract? Like that's just not a good
[10:05] productive use of my team's time. And a
[10:08] lot of the times like we're emotional
[10:10] and so we're not going to commit this
[10:11] logistically and factually. And so I
[10:13] would rather not be spending my
[10:14] employees time there. I would rather be
[10:17] spending their time at inerson events
[10:18] nurturing those relationships and taking
[10:21] George golfing because that's his
[10:23] favorite hobby and we got to learn that
[10:24] about him. This agent is the
[10:27] interconnected
[10:29] um agent that has access to every piece
[10:31] of my text stack but also it has access
[10:34] to every email I have. And so it can
[10:37] look at where I'm going to be a year
[10:40] before and and it can look at my
[10:42] schedule, what I've got going on, my
[10:44] different opportunities that aren't
[10:45] necessarily about AI workforce academy
[10:47] or AI workforce alliance. And it can
[10:49] take all of that and it can form a
[10:51] comprehensive plan so that if Ashley as
[10:54] herself is going to be speaking at this
[10:55] conference in Vegas in February, then
[10:58] what are the opportunities for the
[10:59] academy? What are the opportunities for
[11:00] the alliance? Who are people that Ashley
[11:02] said she wanted to network with before?
[11:04] or who are clients that we currently
[11:06] have that are out there that I could
[11:07] potentially have a visit with and check
[11:09] up on. So, it really acts as my second
[11:11] brain so that I'm not just running
[11:12] around like a chicken with my head cut
[11:14] off as as a solo founder. It's really
[11:16] able to try to find the the strategy
[11:19] that I talk about and and add to all the
[11:22] time, but optimize my my productivity
[11:25] even more because there can always be
[11:26] more. I saw here that you've got a a CFO
[11:30] uh who's an AI and uh so I wanted to ask
[11:33] you number one, how did they compare?
[11:35] How does it compare to flesh and blood
[11:39] CFOs? And did you give it a happy
[11:42] personality? I made the CFO way more
[11:46] aggressive than I usually would because
[11:48] of that that notion that that most folks
[11:51] come into whether it's like one of my
[11:53] employees or um you know somebody else
[11:56] at the organization that I'm trying to
[11:57] win over saying oh well our CFO is tough
[12:00] like good luck with him. Most of the
[12:02] time it's just like this this mismatch
[12:04] of understanding like the root problem.
[12:07] And so I made this persona really
[12:09] aggressive in the fact that um the three
[12:11] focuses I wanted to enhance by creating
[12:14] this persona were the pitch, the actual
[12:17] offering, and the closing hook. Because
[12:20] when we're talking about small
[12:21] businesses especially, those are often
[12:24] the three areas that they get wrong, one
[12:26] of those three. And with CFOs, you have
[12:28] less time to make your point. You have
[12:30] less time to experiment as a small
[12:32] business and get it right. And so the
[12:33] idea to experiment synthetically and get
[12:37] grilled and annihilated safely from the
[12:39] comfort of your own home so that you can
[12:40] take that as a learning experiment and
[12:43] not be doing that face to face with your
[12:45] real customer and prospect. That was
[12:47] what I wanted to to give my employees
[12:49] and myself is I'm going to give you the
[12:52] worst CFO that you could possibly be in
[12:53] front of. And by the way, they're fake.
[12:55] We're not watching you talk to them.
[12:57] This is for your benefit and your
[12:59] benefit only. Go wild. try like try your
[13:02] lines. And the on the back end of this,
[13:05] the coding is um if the representative
[13:09] can give the offering, the pitch and the
[13:13] close in terms of the least emotional,
[13:17] the least products and features, and the
[13:19] most business revenue focused, then they
[13:22] get nice answers. the more they explain
[13:24] the products and features, the more they
[13:27] try to push uh a painoint that they
[13:29] think is a generic CFO painoint, the
[13:31] more aggressive the CFO gets.
[13:33] >> Jobs taking 40 hours a week are down to
[13:36] like 15 hours now. Um where
[13:41] what were the key tasks and processes
[13:43] that you started at? And when in your
[13:45] automation,
[13:46] >> I was actually pulling in more so 80
[13:49] hours a work week because I just didn't
[13:50] have enough time in that in that 40
[13:53] hours to get done the work that I felt
[13:55] like needed to be done. So the five
[13:58] tasks that I immediately started to to
[14:00] look at and optimize were content
[14:02] repurposing.
[14:03] Um it was email inbox management,
[14:07] researching and prep, client onboarding
[14:09] and delivery. Uh and then lead
[14:11] qualification and the pipeline
[14:13] management that comes with that. In
[14:15] those five tasks, let's just look at
[14:16] them one by one. So for content
[14:18] repurposing, I was spending hours
[14:19] turning every piece of content into
[14:21] multiple formats. And so I revamped
[14:25] that. My entire content marketing
[14:27] operation is Notion, Claude, Descript,
[14:31] Canva, Buffer, and Opus Clip. That's it.
[14:34] >> Your content creation marketing stack
[14:37] costs you about $75 a month.
[14:39] >> Yes. Notion is at the center of
[14:41] everything. And I don't mean in terms of
[14:43] like task management. I mean every piece
[14:44] of content I have ever written lives in
[14:46] Notion. Every LinkedIn post, every
[14:47] newsletter, every talk transcript, every
[14:49] client story. Uh but more importantly
[14:52] also in notion is my brand identity, my
[14:55] archetypes, my content pillars, my my
[14:58] voice guidelines, the words I use, what
[15:00] I refuse to use, my origin story. And so
[15:03] when I go to create content, I'm not
[15:06] starting from zero and neither is
[15:07] Claude. So, if I have everything stored
[15:10] in notion and organized, then when I'm
[15:13] using Claude in my content marketing
[15:15] stack, and I hope that folks copy this
[15:17] because they should, when I use Claude,
[15:19] I'm integrating Cloud to research what's
[15:21] being discussed right now, like what is
[15:23] trending, what are the questions people
[15:25] are asking, what debates are happening
[15:27] right now. That research is getting
[15:29] pulled directly into notion, and then
[15:31] it's getting tagged by my content
[15:33] pillars so that it's relevant. And then
[15:36] when I draft, Claude doesn't get a
[15:39] prompt. It gets my brand document, my
[15:41] pillars, all of my information. And when
[15:45] I draft, it's getting drafted the same
[15:47] way that this started. It's getting
[15:48] drafted into one long form video content
[15:52] that I can then tweak and iterate and
[15:55] hate and revise as much as I want. And
[15:57] then it gets reformatted into the
[16:00] different posts and the different
[16:01] formats and the different channels. And
[16:03] I'll use Descript to help me do that. in
[16:05] terms of editing and I'll use Opus Clip
[16:06] in terms of um getting the content in
[16:09] the right formats at the right times
[16:11] with the captions and then Buffer of
[16:13] course to schedule it all because I
[16:15] can't be in all the places at once. So
[16:17] that was that was just one task and
[16:20] honestly out of all five of them I think
[16:22] selfishly my favorite out of the all
[16:25] five that really I think showed me
[16:30] the optimization in ways I wasn't used
[16:32] to seeing before was the lead
[16:34] qualification and pipeline management
[16:37] because I don't think anyone has a a a
[16:39] perfect way of doing this at this point
[16:42] and it is very manual as far as like
[16:45] scoring and enriching your inbound leads
[16:47] and then like creating the nurture
[16:49] sequences until they're sales ready and
[16:52] like what is sales ready? Is it an MQL?
[16:54] What's an MQL? Well, if this is an MQL,
[16:56] when is it SQL? So, like all these
[16:58] little nuances that do exist in every
[17:00] business but bubble up to even bigger
[17:03] visible opportunities for executives.
[17:07] That was really where I I spent the
[17:09] majority of the time out of all five of
[17:11] those tasks because I decided what and
[17:15] who I actually wanted to work with um
[17:18] based on what I was seeing in the CRM
[17:20] and then I just gave the AI that I was
[17:23] working with at the time the
[17:25] qualification and the criteria um
[17:27] because as a marketer it's half formula
[17:30] and it's half experimentation and
[17:32] especially with small businesses you
[17:34] don't have the luxury of time and so
[17:36] when it comes comes to lead
[17:37] qualification, you don't really have the
[17:39] luxury of getting it wrong. Enterprises
[17:40] can get that wrong for a couple months
[17:42] and then at some point that will catch
[17:44] up, right? Uh small businesses, they
[17:46] don't have that time. And so being able
[17:48] to look at your CRM and see what has
[17:51] worked in the past, what hasn't worked,
[17:53] creating the formulas, and then just
[17:55] using your gut when you're actually
[17:57] trying to refine your strategy for leads
[17:59] and qualifying them or perhaps change
[18:02] your nurture sequences. That's where I
[18:04] decided to spend the human time. And
[18:05] that was ultimately out of all five of
[18:07] those tasks, the one that saved me the
[18:09] most time, automating email and inbox
[18:11] management. So just drafting responses
[18:14] to routine questions from multiple
[18:17] people. I really enjoyed automating that
[18:19] because I kept the relationship critical
[18:21] emails, anything involving negotiation
[18:23] or conflict or nuance. But then I
[18:26] automated the part of opening my email
[18:29] inbox and it already being in priority
[18:31] levels of what is most urgent and it
[18:34] already had drafted responses for the
[18:36] ones that weren't critical. So that was
[18:38] that was the third task that I
[18:40] automated. And then research and prep
[18:42] was the the remaining task. So before
[18:46] every client call speaking engagement I
[18:48] was manually researching the company and
[18:50] attendees and industry context. And now
[18:53] and then I automated compiling all the
[18:56] documentation, all the research, the
[18:58] LinkedIn updates and posts, um even like
[19:02] comments on YouTube channels that folks
[19:05] were actually adding. Like I wanted to
[19:06] know everything and I wanted it to be in
[19:08] one nice briefing document so that I
[19:09] walked into every conversation informed
[19:12] without doing all of that upfront leg
[19:14] work. So I just automated all of that
[19:17] except for the part of deciding like
[19:19] what to do with the information, right?
[19:21] um and how I was going to use it.
[19:23] >> You work with a lot of clients um and
[19:26] from different sizes, mediumsiz
[19:27] enterprises, larger and some and and
[19:30] some smaller. So for especially for
[19:32] smaller businesses um what have you seen
[19:35] them
[19:37] spending the most time on in terms of
[19:39] repetitive tasks and if you had some
[19:42] advice for them like where's the first
[19:44] place that you would have them start if
[19:45] you're looking at sort sort of the
[19:47] broader organization? So my short answer
[19:50] to this is any task that your team hates
[19:54] because if they hate doing it, they're
[19:56] not going to pour their heart and soul
[19:57] into it. If it's just something that
[19:59] they dread doing. For me, what it comes
[20:02] down to and when I have to name those
[20:04] tasks, it's back and forth emails that
[20:06] are a necessity to the business. It's
[20:08] things like social media posting, which
[20:09] can become very tedious. And also, I
[20:12] don't know anyone who actually enjoys
[20:13] posting on social media, but you have to
[20:15] out of necessity. uh data entry and so
[20:18] those those three areas I would say
[20:20] would be the biggest call outs in terms
[20:22] of where small businesses could be
[20:23] saving their money. So looking at how
[20:25] you can automate those portions of it to
[20:27] give your humans back more time to spend
[20:32] you know that time doing tasks that are
[20:35] connected to revenue opportunities for
[20:37] the business but also fill their cup so
[20:39] that they're putting more energy into
[20:40] them. That's what I would say you should
[20:42] start with. 2026 is going to be messy.
[20:44] There's still going to be a lot of
[20:46] information out there. Some of it's
[20:47] going to be valid. Some of it's going to
[20:49] be misinformation. Um,
[20:52] you can't really put too much weight on
[20:54] on what the news is saying you should do
[20:56] with AI or what your favorite company is
[20:58] doing with AI because unfortunately we
[21:00] can't actually look in their books and
[21:02] see what's what's happening, right? Like
[21:04] we can't just see that they're, you
[21:06] know, generating $10 billion and be
[21:08] like, "Yep, that sounds great. We're
[21:10] going to go do it now, but we have no
[21:11] blueprint for how you did it and we're
[21:12] just going to take your word for it."
[21:13] Like that's not a thing. I would say
[21:15] pause before you automate anything.
[21:18] Track every task that you're doing for 2
[21:21] to 3 weeks and then ask yourself these
[21:24] questions. Does this require my
[21:26] judgment, relationships or creativity?
[21:29] Does this follow a predictable pattern?
[21:31] And then what's the cost of getting it
[21:33] wrong? The first two questions, if it's
[21:36] a yes, then it's a good candidate for
[21:37] automation. The third question is really
[21:40] just a benchmark for
[21:43] how much human oversight is needed. And
[21:45] so the the first two questions are
[21:47] really your guiding principles and are
[21:49] these tasks things that actually are
[21:51] good candidates for automation? And then
[21:53] if they are great, but if you get these
[21:56] wrong, what is that going to do for you
[21:58] and your career? What's that going to do
[21:59] for your business? So kind of look at
[22:01] the at it as like an autonomy spectrum
[22:03] in terms of find your good use cases for
[22:05] AI, but then put them in a certain order
[22:08] that makes you motivated every single
[22:11] time that you knock one of those use
[22:12] cases out and you've got really great
[22:14] metrics. Don't just jump all in all at
[22:16] once trying to solve everything because
[22:18] you're not going to be able to and you
[22:20] are going to fail. So the idea isn't, oh
[22:23] my gosh, I don't want to use AI agents
[22:24] because what if they fail? They're going
[22:26] to fail. They are. Um the idea is when
[22:29] you have those good use cases, put them
[22:31] in an order so that you can take the
[22:33] least scary, least risky use case and
[22:36] solve it and get a little bit of a
[22:37] habit, a little bit of a muscle memory
[22:39] built up and then continue to build up
[22:41] your use cases in terms of more risk but
[22:44] more ROI as you go. So it's not an all
[22:46] or one. It's very much a spectrum. I
[22:49] think that a lot of the businesses who
[22:51] are who are smart are looking at AI and
[22:55] automations and even generative AI as as
[22:58] foundational steps. And so they're
[22:59] they're looking at their tech stack and
[23:01] their tools that they've been using for
[23:02] years and they're learning how to play
[23:04] with the AI components of those tools
[23:06] and then they're going from there to
[23:08] actually solo experimenting with
[23:10] automation tools and and being able to
[23:13] derive real value and productivity gains
[23:15] for themselves. I think that that's the
[23:17] expectation that we should set for for
[23:19] 2026 because you can't skip those two
[23:22] foundational elements and go right into
[23:24] building agents. When you're building
[23:26] automations and agents, it's the exact
[23:27] same thing. The only difference is
[23:29] agents have more autonomy. So, there's
[23:31] way more risk involved than automations.
[23:33] But if you don't have a documentation of
[23:36] how you're working and what you're doing
[23:38] and what the strategy is and it's
[23:40] written down and your humans are already
[23:42] normalizing it and and using that
[23:44] standardized approach, you're not going
[23:46] to be able to add automations and agents
[23:48] to it. So I would say going back to the
[23:50] basics, making sure that we're
[23:52] challenging what exists and if it's
[23:55] actually working for the businesses and
[23:57] then figuring out a way to do that
[24:00] faster, do it better, scale it out more.
[24:03] um and then automate the parts of it
[24:04] after we do that work up front. That's
[24:07] where the businesses that are smart are
[24:08] are going in 2026.
