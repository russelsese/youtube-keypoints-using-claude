[00:00] With AI writing a good chunk of the
[00:01] code, now more than ever, the tools we
[00:03] use matter. That's why in today's video,
[00:05] I'm going to be sharing with you all the
[00:07] tools that I use, my web and mobile
[00:09] frameworks, what I use for styling, what
[00:11] I use for payments, what I use for
[00:12] authentication, the tools I use to build
[00:14] AI apps, where I deploy my applications,
[00:17] the AI tools I use to build my
[00:18] applications, what models do I use. Is
[00:20] it just Opus 4.5 or is there another
[00:22] model? What chat apps did I use? I'm
[00:24] literally going to be sharing with you
[00:25] my entire tech and tool stack that I use
[00:28] when shipping apps using AI. We're going
[00:31] to get in the weeds with this one. I
[00:32] hope you're ready. I hope you're
[00:33] excited. Let's get into it. So, first
[00:35] things first, let's talk about the web
[00:37] and mobile frameworks I use. What tools
[00:39] do I use to build my web and mobile
[00:42] applications? And for the most part,
[00:44] this has been pretty standard. There is
[00:46] a new addition to the pack, and I'll
[00:47] explain why in a second. But I genuinely
[00:50] believe with all these tools, I can ship
[00:52] any web and mobile app. So if you've
[00:55] been watching my YouTube channel, you
[00:56] know that I've been a big fan of Nex.js
[00:58] and I've been using Nex.js for quite
[01:00] some time now. I know there's some of
[01:01] you that are probably going to say, why
[01:03] not Tanstack Start? And I've played
[01:05] around with Tanstack Start. It's
[01:06] actually really great. My only qualms
[01:08] with it is there are actually two
[01:10] things. First and foremost, the AI
[01:12] models have not been trained on it. So
[01:14] it definitely does hallucinate. Now, I
[01:16] know you can probably add some skills or
[01:18] some like example code or some snippets
[01:20] and it'll like steer in the right
[01:21] direction, but it's not as good as it is
[01:23] with Nex.js when you you you're using
[01:25] AI. And the second thing is Tanstack is
[01:28] still in release candidate, right? So,
[01:29] it's not even 1.0 version, and it's
[01:31] really difficult for me to ship
[01:33] something to production with something
[01:34] that's still in release candidate. So,
[01:37] we're using Nex.js as our front end. I
[01:40] use EliciaJS. Now, most of you might not
[01:43] be familiar with Alicia JS, but a simple
[01:46] way of thinking about it is if you're
[01:48] familiar with Hano, in my opinion,
[01:50] Alicia is better. It's basically a
[01:52] back-end framework. Think of how Express
[01:55] is for NodeJS, Alicia is for bun, but it
[01:59] also works with Node and I really like
[02:03] Alysia. Now, how do I use Alysia with
[02:06] Nex.js? Am I using it as a separate
[02:08] server? there is um a way instead of
[02:11] using the Nex.js default API, you can
[02:14] use Alysia as the backend on your Nex.js
[02:17] app. So you can see here it tells you
[02:19] with the nextJS app router, we can use
[02:21] Alisia on Next.js routes. All you would
[02:24] have to do is create an app/ API then
[02:27] have slugs/out.ts
[02:30] and then you literally copy this code
[02:32] and it's fantastic. And I'm actually
[02:33] just going to set this up with you real
[02:34] quick. So we're just going to spin up a
[02:36] simple uh Nex.js JS application. We're
[02:39] just going to call this demo video.
[02:42] We're going to use the recommended
[02:43] settings. So, our NexJS project has been
[02:45] set up. Now, I'm going to go back to
[02:46] Lisia JS. I'm just going to search
[02:48] Nex.js.
[02:49] And I literally just had it. Where'd it
[02:51] go? Right here. Integration with Nex.js.
[02:53] We're just going to follow these
[02:54] instructions. Let me open my project up
[02:57] in cursor real quick. We called it demo
[02:59] video. Let's just open this up in
[03:01] cursor. So, we have our NextJS project
[03:03] here. All that we're told to do is we
[03:05] need to create this file right here. So
[03:08] under the API route, uh, slugs.rod.ts,
[03:11] this is basically a catchall route. So
[03:13] basically what it does is any APIs that
[03:15] you write in Nex.js, the catch all route
[03:17] will catch them. That's why it's called
[03:19] catch all route. And we'll be using
[03:21] Alysia instead. So I'm just going to
[03:23] copy that. And then under app, we're
[03:26] going to create new file. We're going to
[03:28] paste that. And then we have our route
[03:30] created. And then I'm literally just
[03:32] going to paste this code right here. And
[03:35] we're going to binstall Alysia.
[03:39] And we're also going to just bun install
[03:40] everything else. And then the errors
[03:42] should disappear. Perfect. And what's
[03:44] cool about using Alysia within Nex.js is
[03:47] you can add Eden, which is basically
[03:50] their version of TRPC, which gives you
[03:52] endtoend type safety. So to set this up,
[03:54] all I have to do is create a treaty
[03:56] client. So I'm just going to copy this
[03:58] and under the lip folder, create an
[03:59] Eden.ts ts file. So I'm going to create
[04:02] a lib folder and underneath it we're
[04:05] going to do eden.ts.
[04:07] We're going to click paste here and then
[04:09] we're just going to install what we need
[04:12] to install. So bun install this package
[04:15] right here. So instead of type, we're
[04:17] going to just remove that type and make
[04:19] sure on the route.ts that app is
[04:21] exported. So we have that set up. Now
[04:24] that we have everything set up, I'm
[04:26] going to show you how amazing using
[04:28] Alisiajs is and how the type safety is
[04:30] going to help our AI. So whenever I want
[04:33] to call a route, all I have to do is
[04:35] import API from Eden. When I click on
[04:38] the period, you see that I have my get
[04:40] request, my post request. So it's fully
[04:41] type safe. I'm just going to type in the
[04:44] get request and I'm just going to close
[04:46] the brackets. And here's what's cool
[04:49] about using Alisia, right? I if I just
[04:52] console log this message right here. Let
[04:54] me console log message and I'm going to
[04:58] run this server. You're going to see
[05:00] what is returned in message. So let's go
[05:02] and localhost
[05:05] 3000.
[05:07] We're going to inspect
[05:10] console. So when we look at what's
[05:11] returned, we see the data hello world.
[05:14] We see the error return null. We see
[05:16] response. We see status 200. So what I
[05:19] can do is I can break up message and I
[05:21] can get the data, the error, the status,
[05:23] the response and you can do whatever you
[05:25] want with that information, right? I
[05:26] like Alicia for this. So yeah, when I
[05:29] use Nex.js, I make sure I use Alicia.
[05:31] But here's the thing, Alicia is not
[05:33] going to be my main backend. I'll use it
[05:35] for one-off routes or if there's a
[05:37] particular reason I need a Nex.js API, I
[05:39] will use that. But my backend of choice
[05:41] is Convix. Now, I already hear some of
[05:43] you, you're only mentioning Convix cuz
[05:45] you worked there. And I would agree with
[05:47] you if I didn't use it for every single
[05:49] project I build. Literally every project
[05:52] I use, I use Convex. And it's not
[05:54] because I work there. Well, first and
[05:55] foremost, I'm the one who reached out to
[05:57] them and said, "Give me a job cuz I love
[05:58] the product so much." But truth be told,
[06:00] it's the amount of things that Convex
[06:02] does for you. You need a database, a
[06:04] real-time database, you got it. You want
[06:06] a clean separation between your
[06:08] functions and your DB. You don't want to
[06:10] call your DB directly on the client, you
[06:12] got it. You want to be able to handle
[06:14] web hooks, you got it. You want to be
[06:15] able to handle crown jobs, you got it.
[06:17] You want to handle scheduled functions,
[06:19] scheduled jobs, background jobs, cues,
[06:21] any sort of job except getting a real
[06:23] job, you got it. So, Convex literally
[06:26] handles everything for me backend
[06:29] related and it's done right. Here's the
[06:32] thing about using Convex. It's not just
[06:33] a technical decision where yes, the DX
[06:35] is great, but it's also like from an AI
[06:38] perspective, the models are so good at
[06:40] writing convex code. And the reason
[06:42] being is I'm going to show you the
[06:43] reason actually. It's very simple. The
[06:45] reason why AI is great with Convex is
[06:48] I'm just going to set up Convex on this
[06:51] project. I'm going to run mpx convex
[06:53] dev. I'm going to create a new project.
[06:55] I already have an account set up. And
[06:57] watch this. Notice how a convex folder
[06:59] just popped up. Everything in convex,
[07:02] whatever setup configuration, whatever
[07:05] feature you want to use, you want to set
[07:06] up, you spin up a DB, you want to have
[07:08] scheduled jobs, whatever it is, all of
[07:10] it is code. If all of it is code, that
[07:12] means you can use the AI to build all
[07:15] these crazy things. I don't have to go
[07:16] to the dashboard and configure something
[07:18] or turn something on. All of it is code.
[07:20] Think of Terraform but for your back
[07:23] end. But it's all Typescript and it's
[07:25] all type safe and it's real time by
[07:27] default. Like the amount of highquality
[07:29] applications you can build at warp speed
[07:31] if you just make the decision to use
[07:33] Convex is astronomical. Like an example
[07:36] I'll give you just like a quick example.
[07:38] I I'm a big I'm a big personal finance
[07:41] guy. I love investing and one of the
[07:42] things that I do is like I really keep
[07:44] up with the markets, right? One thing
[07:46] that I wanted is I wanted to have my own
[07:47] personal dashboard where I can track
[07:49] like my portfolio but I can also track
[07:52] certain price levels, right? But I
[07:53] didn't want to go like on trading view
[07:55] all the time. I wanted to have just a
[07:57] simple mobile app. And this is how I
[07:59] built it. I basically used Trading View.
[08:02] I used Trading Views
[08:04] um Trading Views alerts, right? Right? I
[08:07] don't know why I'm writing this down,
[08:08] but I used Trading Views alerts. And
[08:10] basically, they have this feature where
[08:12] you can give them a web hook and they'll
[08:13] fire data to the web hook. And what I
[08:15] used was Convex. I had a Convex
[08:18] application set up. I had a Convex
[08:20] backend, right? Let me just write Convex
[08:22] over here. I had a Convex backend and
[08:25] then I had a Nex.js, you know, I was
[08:27] using Next.js for the front end, right?
[08:29] And basically what was happening was I
[08:31] set up a Convex web hook. I gave it to
[08:34] Trading View alerts. Trading View would
[08:36] fire the alert to Convex and because
[08:39] whenever something changes in the
[08:41] database and Convex automatically it
[08:44] updates on your front end because that
[08:47] is by default how convex works. I would
[08:50] get real time alerts on my Nex.js app on
[08:54] the mobile app on the expo app and all
[08:56] it took was npx convex dev right and
[08:59] setting up a web hook is as simple. If I
[09:01] go into the docs and I just search web
[09:03] hooks, you could see HTTP actions. It's
[09:06] as simple as setting that up right
[09:08] there. That's your web hook right there.
[09:10] It's so simple. It's so easy. It's fully
[09:12] type- safe. I can't imagine a world
[09:14] where I'm building applications without
[09:17] convex. And it just so happens that the
[09:19] AI loves convex a lot. Next up, Turbo
[09:23] Repo. If you're going to be using any
[09:25] sort of monor repo, you're building a
[09:26] mobile app and a web app, Turbo Repo is
[09:28] the obvious choice. And if I'm building
[09:30] a mobile app, I'm going to use Expo.
[09:32] I've played around a little bit with
[09:34] Swift UI, but um it's just for Apple. I
[09:37] want to be crossplatform or cross
[09:39] device. So Expo allows me to do that.
[09:41] And it's React, so it's just easy and
[09:43] simple to get started. Now, in terms of
[09:46] styling, I mean, it's pretty simple.
[09:48] Tailwind V4 and Chat CNN UI. And what I
[09:50] love about the direction Shatnui is
[09:53] going is I'll be honest, I usually start
[09:56] here. I'll go on shhats and UI and I'll
[09:58] click new project and then I can
[10:00] customize. Okay, I'll use base UI for
[10:02] the base component and then let's say I
[10:04] want the style to be more mirror where
[10:07] it's a little bit compact and the radius
[10:09] I want there to be none. I want it to be
[10:11] super boxy and maybe for the theme let's
[10:13] go a little emerald, a nice little green
[10:15] or maybe that feels a little too
[10:17] corpority. Let's go sky blue. Right? So
[10:19] I'll literally start here. I'll click
[10:20] create project and then I'll just run
[10:22] this bunx command. This is my starting
[10:24] port most of the time and Shadzian is my
[10:27] default styling library, component
[10:29] library, whatever you want to call it.
[10:31] Now, payments for payments, I'm using
[10:35] Stripe. And here's the thing, when
[10:37] you're using Convex, using Stripe or
[10:41] Polar or Autumn or Dodo Payments,
[10:43] whatever payment provider you want to
[10:45] use, it's super simple. And the reason
[10:47] why is Convex has this thing called
[10:49] components. And essentially components
[10:52] are independent modular TypeScript
[10:54] building blocks for your backend. So I
[10:57] can click on payments here and I have
[10:59] full components for Stripe, for Polar,
[11:02] for Autumn and for Dodo payments. By the
[11:04] way, someone really handsome is the one
[11:06] who made the Stripe component. I would
[11:08] know cuz it's big. But in all
[11:10] seriousness, the convex component takes
[11:13] care of everything for me. So let's say
[11:15] I wanted to use the stripe component.
[11:17] It's as simple as literally, let me just
[11:20] close this real quick. It's as simple as
[11:22] installing the component. And then what
[11:25] I would do is like literally, you can
[11:26] use AI for this. You can give AI the
[11:30] repo. Like you could literally create a
[11:32] new agent and be like, build out a
[11:35] subscription for me using Stripe, but
[11:39] using Convex's Stripe component. Here's
[11:44] the repo. And I would just let AI spin
[11:47] it up. And 10 times out of 10, every
[11:50] time I've done this, it's got it
[11:51] absolutely right. So I like this is why
[11:54] again using Convex as a perk is a plus
[11:57] because there are a lot of these great
[11:58] components that exist. Let's say you
[12:00] wanted to build like some really durable
[12:02] workflows. You can use the workflow
[12:05] component. You can use the workpool
[12:06] component. There's a lot of these great
[12:08] components and integrations that you can
[12:10] use. Let's say I want storage. I can use
[12:12] Cloudflare R2. Let's say I want emails,
[12:14] right? I can use recent and all this
[12:16] code is already written for me. All I
[12:17] have to do is just install the component
[12:19] in my convinc.
[12:22] So yeah, for payments I'm using stripe.
[12:24] I haven't used autumn but to be honest
[12:26] if I had to do some usage based billing
[12:28] or some AI credit stuff billing I would
[12:30] use autumn. They have a convex component
[12:31] so it would make life easier. Now in
[12:34] terms of O there's clerk, there's work
[12:37] OS, there's better off. Here's how I
[12:38] think about it. I will say out of the
[12:40] three the easiest to set up is clerk.
[12:43] It's just I'm just be honest. I do like
[12:45] Better Off Barracks the homie. Uh and
[12:48] Better Off there's a lot of great
[12:49] integrations and they even have a convex
[12:51] component that's getting a lot of
[12:53] improvements and it might be my def
[12:55] facto but as of yet clerk is still the
[12:57] simplest to use. But if I wanted like
[12:59] some sort of enterprise solution, I was
[13:01] building an enterprise app. I'm 100%
[13:03] going for work OS. Here's the thing. You
[13:05] can't go wrong with any of these. I've
[13:06] used Better Off. I've used Clerk. I've
[13:08] used work OS. I use all three of them.
[13:11] But there are different reasons why I
[13:12] would pick one. All three solutions are
[13:14] great. Now, building AI apps. What I
[13:17] mean by this is what are the tools I
[13:19] would use when building AI apps. The
[13:21] first one I want to talk about is
[13:23] Daytona. I've been using Daytona a lot
[13:26] the last couple of days. And the reason
[13:28] why is I've been working on most of you
[13:31] if you've seen the previous video have
[13:33] seen Ralphie, which is basically Ralph
[13:35] on steroids. It's this uh autonomous
[13:37] loop basically running all sorts of
[13:39] agents autonomously. We're at 1.6k star.
[13:43] So, if you could give us a star, I would
[13:45] really appreciate it. That being said,
[13:48] the reason why I've been using Daytona
[13:49] is I want to wrap Ralphie and build an
[13:52] autonomous coding agent app where all
[13:55] you do is plan, you hit enter, and then
[13:57] it builds out the project end to end.
[14:00] Here's the app. It's called Sandstorm.
[14:02] So basically what's happening is we're
[14:03] spinning up cloud code agents in a
[14:05] Daytona sandbox and people are able to
[14:08] build applications in that sandbox. So
[14:10] instead of using their own personal file
[14:12] system, we're using Daytona's file
[14:14] system. We're using Daytona sandbox and
[14:16] I'll be honest, the developer experience
[14:18] for Daytona is absolutely the best. I've
[14:20] used a bunch of other sandbox providers,
[14:23] but nothing comes as close as Daytona.
[14:26] If you're building any sort of AI coding
[14:28] agent or AI agent application and you
[14:31] need access to a file system, I highly
[14:34] recommend use Daytona. I've been using
[14:36] it for Sandstorm and it's been
[14:38] fantastic. AI SDK. AI SDK is basically
[14:41] what I use to build all my agents. It's
[14:44] SDK by Versell. It's probably one of the
[14:46] most popular TypeScript AI SDKs. Very
[14:49] well supported, very well documented.
[14:51] Lots of tutorials on it. There's no
[14:53] reason why you shouldn't use it. The
[14:54] underdog though, or should I say the
[14:56] most slept on agent that people are
[14:59] using but not a lot of people are
[15:00] talking about is Claude's agent SDK
[15:03] because this agent SDK is cloud code,
[15:06] right? You can spin up cloud code
[15:08] instances. You can spin up cloud code
[15:10] agents um and you can have them do
[15:12] plethora of things whether you're
[15:14] building a coding agent or some sort of
[15:15] assistant or whatever it is. You take
[15:18] this agent SDK, you give it access to a
[15:21] sandbox, you can do a lot of amazing
[15:24] things, build a lot of amazing AI
[15:26] applications. So, highly recommend you
[15:28] use that. And then last but not least is
[15:30] Composio. Composio is basically my tool
[15:35] layer, right? So, let's say I wanted to
[15:37] build an AI application that has access
[15:41] to my Gmail or a customer's Gmail, my
[15:45] Google calendar, and a bunch of other
[15:48] tools, right? Slack, GitHub, Google
[15:50] Sheets, Shopify, Google Drive, like
[15:53] there are plenty of integrations you can
[15:55] give an AI like an agent and it would do
[15:59] extremely awesome things, right? But
[16:01] building that integration layer and all
[16:02] those tools and connecting all those
[16:04] tools is difficult. Compose abstracts
[16:06] that. It makes it so simple that with a
[16:09] few clicks and a bit of line of code
[16:11] like I'll show you. If we go to the
[16:14] docs, let's go to the overview. Let's
[16:16] say you're using AI SDK, right? It's as
[16:18] simple as initializing composio, right?
[16:20] You're going to have uh the user is
[16:22] going to have some sort of user ID.
[16:23] You're going to create a tool router
[16:25] session and then you literally give it
[16:27] access in stream text. So you see you
[16:30] have tools here. Now it has access to
[16:32] all the tools you've configured on the
[16:34] Composio dashboard. And there's
[16:36] hundreds, thousands of tools, and
[16:38] building that yourself is a headache.
[16:40] Composio is a no-brainer. Every time I
[16:42] build AI applications, I'm using all
[16:45] these tools. Now, deployments, where am
[16:48] I deploying my applications? There's two
[16:49] places really. Uh, for the most part,
[16:51] I'm using Verscell to deploy my NexJS
[16:54] applications, but there are instances
[16:55] where I'll need a separate server. And
[16:57] for that, I'm using Railway. Railway is
[16:59] absolutely amazing. I know they don't
[17:01] have a free tier, but the $5 is worth
[17:03] it. The DX is amazing. Let's like like
[17:06] let's say like I'm no fan of Postgress,
[17:09] but let's say I wanted to spin up a
[17:11] Postgress database, right? It's as
[17:13] simple as as follows. I'm going to click
[17:14] new. I'm going to click databases.
[17:17] I'm going to click Postgress.
[17:20] And it is spinning up a Postgress
[17:22] instance as we speak. And there you have
[17:24] it. I have a Postgress database, right?
[17:26] I can go to settings and configure
[17:28] whatever it is I want. I can get the
[17:31] database public URL. Meaning if I want
[17:33] to expose this to another service like
[17:35] if I have another backend server that I
[17:36] haven't deployed here, I can do that.
[17:38] But if I wanted to let's say deploy a
[17:41] server here, a back-end server that was
[17:43] going to communicate with this database,
[17:44] all I have to do is click create and say
[17:46] I wanted to deploy an Alysia bun server
[17:49] using Drizzle. I would click that. They
[17:51] have a template there and then I can
[17:53] basically deploy this Alicia server and
[17:55] connect it with this Postgress database
[17:57] and it's going to be so blazing fast
[17:59] because you're in the same deployment.
[18:02] I'm a big fan of railway especially if I
[18:04] need an external server or another
[18:06] server. Railway is my place to go. Now
[18:08] in terms of AI tools, there's a bunch of
[18:11] them. We're using cloud code. We're
[18:14] using cursor. Now some of you might be
[18:15] saying, why are you using cursor? There
[18:16] are actually times I like going back and
[18:18] forth with cursor. I do like the cursor
[18:21] agent itself. I hope you know cursor has
[18:23] their own CLI. Like if you didn't know,
[18:26] you can literally type I can type in
[18:27] agent and what pops up right here is
[18:30] going to be the cursor agent, the cursor
[18:32] CLI and it's pretty good. So I'll use
[18:34] the cursor editor because I like
[18:36] reviewing the code. I like writing code,
[18:37] but I'll also be using cloud code. For
[18:39] terminal, I'm using Ghosty. Ghosty is my
[18:41] terminal at choice. I just like the DX
[18:43] and all my hotkeys. It allows me to move
[18:45] really, really fast. But really the one
[18:49] I've been greenpilled or gravile pled on
[18:52] is GPile. And the reason being is AI
[18:55] code review has allowed me to ship much
[18:58] faster. I'm going to show you the
[19:00] Ralphie repo. And let's just pull up a
[19:03] pull request. Let's look at this right
[19:05] here. Fix Windows line ending handling
[19:07] and markdown task source. Right? So I
[19:10] see someone made a PR. They gave it a
[19:11] submar. There's a test plan. I'm going
[19:14] to look at the gravile overview. Here's
[19:16] how I analyze PRs. Now, if the
[19:19] confidence score is four out of five or
[19:22] greater or five out of five, then I'm
[19:24] reviewing. If it's not, I'm going to
[19:27] tell the person to address the comments.
[19:29] And almost every single time I've seen a
[19:31] five out of five, it is a perfect PR.
[19:34] It's a safe PR. And Graile has sincerely
[19:36] cut down the amount of time I've spent
[19:39] reviewing code that is just blah. And
[19:41] here's the thing, you can even be lazy
[19:44] with this. I can take this reptile
[19:45] review, pass it to the AI I'm using to
[19:48] build the application and say address
[19:50] the comments. And there are even places
[19:51] I don't know if I have maybe let's pull
[19:54] up this uh PR right here. There are
[19:57] places you can see here that Gravile
[19:59] will make comments and it will even
[20:00] offer suggestions. And there are times
[20:02] where it won't offer a suggestion, but
[20:03] it'll give you the prompt to pass to
[20:06] your AI for your AI to fix whatever the
[20:09] issue it flagged. So if you're building
[20:11] anything, especially if you're using AI,
[20:13] you 100% need to use Gravile. Gravile,
[20:16] in my opinion, is one of the best AI
[20:18] code reviewing tools. Now models,
[20:20] there's really two models for
[20:22] programming. I'm only using Opus 4.5
[20:24] thinking. Codeex is cool. Um, there are
[20:27] times where it'll catch like very edge
[20:29] case bugs, but I'm using Opus most of
[20:31] the time. And the reason why I have Open
[20:34] AI here is I definitely do like 5.2 to
[20:37] for just everyday tasks, chatting and
[20:40] all that type of stuff. And speaking of
[20:41] chatting, what chat apps do I use? T3
[20:44] Chat is my daily driver, but I also have
[20:47] a subscription to OpenAI and Claude. The
[20:50] reason why I have a subscription to
[20:51] OpenAI is I like Deep Research every now
[20:53] and then, and my wife uses it as well.
[20:55] And for Claude, I use Claude Co-work
[20:57] sometimes. But T3 chat is my daily
[21:00] driver. Ladies and gents, I know that
[21:02] was a pretty long video, but this is my
[21:05] entire techtool
[21:08] stack. I do plan on updating some of the
[21:10] templates I have on my GitHub repo for
[21:13] you guys to use easily, especially when
[21:15] you're building apps with AI. But I hope
[21:17] this made sense. I hope you enjoyed this
[21:19] video. I hope my decision- making and
[21:21] why I use specific tools matters. At the
[21:24] end of the day, it's very important that
[21:26] you understand these tools, right? I
[21:28] think one edge developers have over
[21:30] non-developers when using AI is we know
[21:33] what's good and what's not. We know what
[21:35] works and what doesn't. And it feels
[21:37] like we're entering an era of more
[21:39] engineering, less programming. Although
[21:41] I'm very sad about it, it is what it is.
[21:43] We have to adapt to the times. We have
[21:46] to be the best at what we do. And I hope
[21:47] you enjoyed this video. Make sure to
[21:49] like, comment, subscribe, hit the
[21:50] notification bell. I'll see you in the
[21:52] next one. Peace.
