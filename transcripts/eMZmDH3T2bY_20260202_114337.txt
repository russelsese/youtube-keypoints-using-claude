[00:00] I don't write code by hand anymore. I just ask  Claude. And in this video, I've partnered with  
[00:05] Anthropic to break down three things that I wish  I knew about Vibe Engineering before I started.  
[00:11] Starting with number one, how to create apps from  scratch. Head to the link in the description below  
[00:16] and let's install Claude Code together. First  up, for Mac users, from the homepage, use this  
[00:23] copy button to copy the bash script and run it  in a terminal window. But for Windows users,  
[00:29] that script looks like this, and it's actually  PowerShell. Now, I ran into problems with this  
[00:35] script. So, I'm going to show you another approach  using npm. If you don't have npm installed or  
[00:41] you're not sure, head over to nodejs.org. Click  this big green button that says get NodeJS. Scroll  
[00:50] down and click the green button to download the  installer. After you successfully install node,  
[00:55] you should be able to open a command prompt, type  in node-v and see the node version returned that  
[01:02] you have installed. Then you use npm install to  install cloud code. You can copy this exact line  
[01:09] from the description under the resources section.  Then type claude and press enter to set it up.  
[01:15] First, choose your text style. I'm going to stick  with dark mode. Then choose how you want to set  
[01:20] up your subscription. I'm going to stick with my  cloud account. Go ahead and sign in and I'll see  
[01:24] you on the other side. Once you've connected  your account, success means you see something  
[01:29] like this. Now, Claude Code is great inside of a  terminal window, but it's even better when it's  
[01:34] integrated with your IDE. For that reason, I'm  going to take you through using Cloud Code inside  
[01:39] of Visual Studio Code. Now, two more quick things  for setup and then let's jump into our first app.  
[01:45] First, let's set up a Git repo. You can do that by  opening a new terminal window by pressing control  
[01:51] shiftbacktick. Then type get and then press  enter. Next, we need a command prompt to open  
[01:57] claude code. So click on this drop-own arrow and  then click on command prompt. Then type in claude  
[02:03] and press enter. Press one to trust this directory  and off we go. Let's create a chore app to manage  
[02:09] chores at the office. Here are the requirements.  Show a calendar view like Outlook to see all our  
[02:15] current chores. allow adding and removing  chores, make chores recurring on a schedule,  
[02:20] assigning chores to team members, and  adding and removing team members. So,  
[02:25] what do you write inside this little box to get  started? If you were vibe coding, you might put  
[02:30] in something like this. Make a chore app to manage  chores at the office. It should show a calendar  
[02:36] view like Outlook to see all our current chores.  But these product requirements are really vague  
[02:41] and it misses out on technical requirements like  the tech stack or the storage solution or even the  
[02:46] architecture as well as engineering principles  like how you want the code written. So here's  
[02:51] what I recommend instead. I'll press escape twice  to clear the prompt area. I'll write a new prompt  
[02:56] which lists the high priority requirements as  bullets and then at the end tells Claude to ask  
[03:01] me questions to clarify requirements, engineering  principles, hard constraints, etc. By the way,  
[03:06] you can type new lines in the prompt by holding  Alt or Option and pressing enter. Finally,  
[03:11] you need to go into plan mode. So, hold the shift  key and press tab until you see plan mode in the  
[03:16] bottom left. Now, when you press enter, Claude  gets to work. It starts reasoning about the code  
[03:21] to write and then figuring out what are the right  questions to ask you to get to the next step of  
[03:26] its plan. When it's in plan mode, it will never  write code automatically. It will always confer  
[03:33] with you first. By the way, I've included this  prompt and all the prompts from the video under  
[03:38] the resources section in the description. Here's  the first set of questions. Your questions may  
[03:43] differ. Let's make this a React app by pressing  one. We'll keep things simple by choosing local  
[03:48] storage. This will run on a big TV screen in the  office, so no off is needed. Claude's also asking  
[03:54] us about extra features, so let's turn on two and  three. If you ever need to change your answers in  
[03:59] this model, you can use the left and right arrow  keys to switch between questions. Then press one  
[04:04] to submit your answers. Claude will now keep going  until it reaches the next set of questions or it  
[04:10] completes your plan. Now it's asking us some more  questions about product requirements. I found that  
[04:16] when you include this ask me questions to clarify  the requirements part of your prompt, you'll get  
[04:21] a richer discussion in plan mode. So now it's got  all the information that it needs. It's going to  
[04:26] create the implementation plan for our review. I  find this process is like working with a teammate  
[04:33] or fellow senior engineer to help plan exactly  what you're going to do before you execute. And  
[04:39] a few seconds later, we get the plan. This is your  opportunity to review before Claude starts writing  
[04:45] code. Be on the lookout for design decisions  Claude has made that you might disagree with.  
[04:51] Here, for example, we never said anything about  Vit or Tailwind. Scrolling down, you'll see a good  
[04:56] summary of the data models, the project structure,  implementation steps, etc. One thing that stands  
[05:02] out to me is that this is in JavaScript, not  TypeScript. So, here's how we tell Claude to make  
[05:08] changes. When asked, would you like to proceed,  select option three, and I'll type use TypeScript  
[05:14] instead of JavaScript. I'll press enter, and  Claude will reconfigure its plans. By the way,  
[05:20] notice how I'm talking to Claude. It's like a  senior engineer that I respect. Clear, firm,  
[05:26] and specific. You don't need to be overly polite,  and you don't need to be overly aggressive. Just  
[05:32] the facts. Okay, the new plan's generated, and we  see file extensions with TS and TSX. That means  
[05:39] we're on the right path. And let's assume we're  good with the rest of the plan. So, it's time to  
[05:43] move forward. You have two options. You can auto  accept all of Claude's changes or manually approve  
[05:49] them one by one. If you're just getting started,  you might want to choose option two just to be  
[05:54] sure, but I'll tell you, you're going to get tired  of it pretty quickly. So, I've suggested to auto  
[05:59] accept edits here. Let's see what happens in just  a minute. Claude's just written the entire app,  
[06:04] which we can see here. Now, it's asking approval  to run npm install. Claude's default user  
[06:10] experience is that it always asks for approval for  these sorts of tools. But if you believe a tool is  
[06:15] safe to use, I recommend choosing option two here.  After a few more approvals, Claude asked to run  
[06:22] the dev server. I'm actually not keen on having  Claude do this, so I'm going to start up a new  
[06:27] terminal window, go to the app directory, and then  start it myself. With the server up and running,  
[06:33] let's check out the app. Okay, we've got a decent  looking page here. Let's add a few team members.  
[06:38] So, I'll start by adding myself. I'll give myself  a green color. And then let's add Kevin. Give him  
[06:44] a blue color. Now, that looks okay. So, let's try  testing the add chore functionality. Let's get  
[06:50] Kevin to bake us cookies every week. So, we'll  assign that to kitchen and then assign that to  
[06:56] Kevin. We'll make this a recurring chore. Repeat  it once a week and click add. That looks good. So,  
[07:03] let's check out the week mode. And we should  be able to see bake cookies down below. Looks  
[07:08] like we've got a little highlighting bug up  here. Finally, let's try adding a chore for  
[07:12] me just by clicking on the calendar. So, we'll  say maintenance and we'll assign this to David.  
[07:18] And oh, interesting. The time is also wrong here.  Let's click add and see where it puts it, though.  
[07:24] Yeah, it looks like it went down to 8:00 p.m.  when it shouldn't have. Now, we're all tempted  
[07:29] to go back into Claude and start prompting it to  fix these bugs. But you need to follow a principle  
[07:34] of committing early and committing often. That's  because when you add more prompts, there's always  
[07:39] a chance of introducing more regressions. So  always make it easy to revert to the last known  
[07:44] good state. By the way, I'm assuming that you're  working inside of a branch when you commit. This  
[07:49] is a great time to review the code and iterate  with Claude. You can try making architecture  
[07:53] changes or even making test cases. Great job. You  just built your first app with Claude code, but  
[08:00] that's not enough to be successful with it. That  leads us to scenario number two. Using cla code  
[08:05] with an existing app. We want to pretend that this  is existing code that you're bringing Claude code  
[08:10] to. To do that, I'll press escape here and then  type slashcle. As you can see, that clears all  
[08:16] of our conversation history and frees up context.  So, it's like Claude is looking at this codebase  
[08:21] for the first time. One mental block I had when I  got started was not knowing how AI would possibly  
[08:27] understand all of my coding standards so it  could keep building on them. The answer is a  
[08:33] file called claude md. According to this blog  post on humanaylayer.dev, dev, which I'll also  
[08:39] link in the description. Claude MD onboards Claude  onto your codebase. The contents of this file get  
[08:45] injected into every Claude session. So, it's  super important that the instructions in this  
[08:49] file are almost universally applicable to the  prompts that you write. Otherwise, Claude might  
[08:54] ignore them. So, we can break down what you  put in this file into three layers. First,  
[08:59] you tell Claude about the tech stack, the project  structure, what the packages are, components,  
[09:04] etc. Then explain the function and purpose of  each component in the project. Finally, describe  
[09:10] how you want Claude to work with the project. For  example, you can instruct Claude to run test cases  
[09:16] and verify success after every change it makes.  You have two options to create that cloud MD file.  
[09:22] You can start with the /init command, but in my  experience, that doesn't create the three types  
[09:27] of information we just reviewed. So, I prefer to  use a prompt. Grab this prompt from the resources  
[09:34] section and paste it in. As you can see, it covers  some of the essentials from that blog post I just  
[09:39] shared, the what, the why, the how, and it pulls  in a couple of other principles as well. One of  
[09:45] those principles is to use progressive disclosure.  So instead of including all the instructions  
[09:51] for everything at once, create an index that  points to other markdown files. So like I have  
[09:57] an architectural patterns file which documents  architectural patterns, design decisions, etc.  
[10:03] After a few minutes, you get a claud file. You  can view a formatted version of this by pressing  
[10:08] commandshiftv or control shiftv on windows. So  now every time you start cla it's acquainted  
[10:14] with the text stack, the project structure, what  are your key files, commands to run everything,  
[10:20] domain model, and there's a few more things here  as well. Just to show this in action, we're going  
[10:25] to make a small change to the adding new feature  section. I'll change this to adding new features  
[10:30] or fixing bugs. And then I'll add a disclaimer  that it's important when you work on a new feature  
[10:36] or bug to create a git branch first. Let's commit  this change. And while I do that, you remember  
[10:41] that bug that we looked at earlier, the one where  clicking on the calendar didn't add the right time  
[10:46] to the chore. Let's go fix this using Claude.  Now, just to prove that Claude MD is working,  
[10:52] I'm going to get out of Claude first and then  restart it and ask the following prompt. Notice  
[10:57] the prompt is nothing fancy. We say it's a bug  fix. We describe the failure condition and then we  
[11:03] let it go. Let's see what Claude does. After a few  minutes, it finds the bug inside of a TSX file,  
[11:09] but before it implements the fix, it asks to  create a new branch. Let's let it proceed. After  
[11:15] a few more permission confirmations, it creates  the new branch and makes the fix. Obviously,  
[11:20] you'll verify that fix on the app itself. We'll  head back into the week mode. Then, we'll make a  
[11:25] chore at 8 a.m. We'll call it bring donuts for the  office. Put it in the kitchen category and assign  
[11:31] it to me. Then, click add. So, this is good. The  bug is fixed here. Now, it's time to check the  
[11:36] code itself. Again, it's useful to think of Claude  as another engineer on your team. You're going to  
[11:41] review its code like everyone else's. If you don't  like something, instead of making a comment, use a  
[11:47] prompt to get Claude to fix it. That was a small  bug, but how does it perform with scenario number  
[11:52] three, a big architecture change? I've just made  a few more fixes, so our grid is looking good,  
[11:58] but now it's time to make a bigger change. Changes  to chores should automatically show up on other  
[12:04] tabs without refreshing. So, how do we get that  test chore to show up on other tabs? Let's head  
[12:10] to Claude and find out. For this change, we'll use  a special mode of Claude code called YOLO. And no,  
[12:17] I'm not kidding. It's when you run Claude with the  dangerously skip permissions switch. In this mode,  
[12:23] Claude doesn't ask for your approval to  run commands. It just does them. Of course,  
[12:27] there's risk with this, but I'm showing you  because one day the speed might be worth it.  
[12:31] You can now toggle this mode on and off by using  shift and tab. Onto the architecture change. Now,  
[12:37] Cloud Code best practices advises an explore,  plan, code, and commit approach. You've already  
[12:43] got the building blocks for this. So, first use  shift and tab to switch into plan mode. Then,  
[12:49] our prompt explains the architecture change and  also tells Claude to explore these files and give  
[12:55] us three options to move forward. This request  for three options is a bit of prompt engineering  
[13:00] because remember any prompt engineering technique  you've learned with LLMs like chatgpt or claude  
[13:06] also applies here. After a few minutes given us  our options. Now there's no web server on this  
[13:12] app right now. So I tried to trick Claude into  only giving us browser sync solutions. But it saw  
[13:17] through that and also suggested option three  which would create a server and do real-time  
[13:22] syncing across clients. I'm making this video to  show you the real power of AI assisted coding. So,  
[13:27] let's go all the way with option three. I'll give  it a minute and we'll see the plan together. Here  
[13:32] we've got Claude's plan. Just like our first  plan, it gives you an overview of the changes,  
[13:37] the project structure, files, it's changing,  a phased approach to implementation, as well  
[13:43] as key design decisions. You could continue  to modify this plan by using option three,  
[13:48] but we'll continue with option one. And because  we have YOLO mode enabled, we can let this run  
[13:53] as long as it needs to get the job done.  In about 5 minutes, it created a websocket  
[13:58] server and explained to us how it works. So the  question remains, does it actually work? Here  
[14:04] I've got two instances of the app side by side.  Let's start by adding a new team member. Let's  
[14:10] add Elizabeth and give her red. And we see that  change in the other browser. Now in this browser,  
[14:17] let's give her a chore called feed the fish. We'll  assign it to her and then click add. That chore  
[14:23] successfully shows up in the first browser. Now  all that's left is for you to review the code.  
[14:28] But don't take my word for it that it works.  Try it yourself. If you enjoyed this video and  
[14:33] want to get started with Claude Code, check out  the link in the description below. Let me know  
[14:38] what else you want to learn about Claude Code in  the comments and I'll see you in the next video.
